    "text": "Rationale\nThe Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study dataset is a large, rich, and complex resource that can drive scientific discovery, translate research to the public domain, and inform development of public policy. As such, it is crucial for researchers to responsibly develop models that accurately reflect the complexity of cognitive and health disparities, accounting for the social and environmental contexts in which people live. Inaccurate representation and interpretation of research findings can undermine scientific rigor and reproducibility. Therefore, the use of ABCD data carries an ethical responsibility, and it is important for researchers to ensure that data analysis and interpretations are conducted with careful attention to responsible data practices.\n\n\n\nWarnings in data documentation\nTo facilitate responsible data use, warnings have been added to variables in the data dictionary and are linked to sections of the data documentation website to provide additional information for data users (e.g. information about data quality issues and guidance on appropriate use of data). These warnings, which may apply at the variable or table level, are included directly in the data dictionary as hyperlinks to the documentation website.\nIn DEAP and Lasso these warnings are indicated by icons:   (Data) and   (Responsible use). In DEAP/Lasso the warning icons are hyperlinked back to the warning on this data documentation website.\nData users would be served to:\n\nReview the data warnings for any variable that you will be downloading and/or using by clicking the link and reviewing the warning associated with that variable\nReview any resources included with the warning and consider guidelines\n\nThere are two types of warnings, data & responsible use. Warnings will be displayed in callout boxes like shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData warning\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this warning is to aid in transparency and refers to technical data issues (e.g., data quality issues, information about how variables are constructed, instructions on how to calculate or analyze specific variables, code if necessary).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsible use warning\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this warning is to provide guidance for responsible data use, interpretation, and communication to enhance rigor and reproducibility. This also includes conceptual warnings (e.g., bias due to attrition or non-response).\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral considerations\nThe ABCD Study provides the following guidance for researchers planning to use the data:\n\nConsider issues related to social and environmental contexts prior to hypothesis testing and throughout the research process.\nConsider the broader social context of development and the potential for adaptation to the environment and developmental change\n\nResearchers should assess whether they have the necessary information to effectively address how social context influences developmental outcomes. It’s essential to recognize the range of youths’ experiences and environments, acknowledging that development is a dynamic process influenced by the potential for adaptation and change (Simmons et al. 2021).\n\nAvoid using social constructs as proxies for environmental factors. Instead, directly measure relevant social, cultural, and environmental variables.\nFollow best practices for selecting and using population descriptors like race, ethnicity, and geographic origin in genetics and genomics research.\nResearchers must be mindful of the limitations when using constructs such as socioeconomic status, and avoid relying on them in isolation (Hoffman et al. 2022). Use inclusive language in scientific communications.\nPerson-first language promotes inclusivity by emphasizing individuals’ inherent value and respecting them as people before describing any conditions or diseases they may have (Bares et al. 2023). Avoid using “addict” and instead use “person with a substance use disorder” or “person recovering from substance use disorder”.\n\nConsiderations for using language regarding people with disabilities: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/materials/factsheets/fs-communicating-with-people.html\nConsiderations for using language regarding people with substance use disorders: https://nida.nih.gov/nidamed-medical-health-professionals/health-professions-education/words-matter-terms-to-use-avoid-when-talking-about-addiction?msclkid=2afe5d9dab9911ec9739d569a06fa382 (Saragosa-Harris et al. 2022)\n\nUse practices for reproducible research, analytical procedures, and reporting of results.\n\nRecently, members of the ABCD consortium reviewed 549 articles using ABCD data and examined the reporting practices and how data from the ABCD Study has been used. There were 31+ items (created after a review of the neuroimaging best practices literature) extracted from each research article. The items covered a wide range of issues related to transparency and reproducibility such as sharing code used for analysis (e.g., on Github, OSF, Zenodo). We found that analytic scripts were shared in 30% of full-length articles. The number of participants excluded due to missing data was reported in 60% of articles, and information on missing data for individual variables (e.g., household income) was provided in 38% of articles. Based on the findings, a set of practical suggestions when using ABCD Study data were provided that may also be applied more broadly to the field of developmental neuroscience (Lopez et al. 2024).ABCD data users can review the checklist of recommendations to improve transparency and reproducibility.\nIt is important to consider features of the data available in ABCD and the strengths and limitations therein and follow guidance. Saragosa-Harris et al. (2022) have developed a practical guide for researchers and reviewers including relevant analytical and methodological considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBares, Sara H, Jasmine R Marcelin, Jill Blumenthal, and Paul E Sax. 2023.

The ABCD protocol captures several SES-related variables for use as potential covariates, but not all environmental influences on cognition are measured.

    "section": "Delay Discounting",
    "text": "Delay Discounting\n nc_y_ddis\nMeasure description: The participant makes several choices between a hypothetical small-immediate reward or a standard hypothetical $100 future reward at different time points (6h, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years). Each block of choices features the same delay to the larger reward and the immediate reward is titrated after each choice until both the smaller-sooner reward and the delayed-$100 reward have equal subjective value to the participant. The summary results file indicates the “indifference point” (the small-immediate amount deemed to have the same subjective value as the $100 delayed reward) at each of the seven delay intervals. When plotted, the area under the curve formed by these indifference points is frequently used to quantify severity of discounting of delayed rewards.\nOrderly delay-discounting task behavior is evidenced by a revealed preference pattern wherein subjective value (SV) indifference points progressively decline with each increasing delay to the hypothetical reward payout. Per the quality control metrics suggested by Johnson and Bickel (2008).\nJBPass1 “yes” (pass) refers to whether the valuation of the standard reward with delay follows an orderly decline, such that neither of the two following criterion were met: (1) if any indifference point (starting with the second delay) was greater than the preceding indifference point by a magnitude greater than 20% of the larger later reward (here, by $20 or more); or (2) the last (5 year) indifference point was not less than the first (6 hour) indifference point by at least a magnitude equal to 10% of the larger later reward (here, by $10 or more).\nvalues.JBPass1_NumberViolations is the tally of delay intervals (blocks) wherein the participant’s revealed subjective value indifference point was $20 or more greater than the indifference point of the next-sooner delay. This value will be “0” for a session wherein the participant showed an orderly decrease (or at least not an increase) in subjective value from each delay to the next-longer delay. The titrating format of the ABCD delay discounting task may increase the likelihood of one or more delay blocks showing an inconsistent pattern, even from an engaged participant. A result that revealed 1 or 2 violations, especially at the later/longer delay blocks (e.g. 5 years) might not substantially affect the overall area-under-curve of subjective value with delay, such that data may still be useable and reflect the participant’s general preferences about waiting to get larger rewards. Therefore, the ABCD Consortium Neurocognition Workgroup recommends not excluding most cases where JBPass 1 is “no”. Several violations of JBpass Criterion 1 (cfvalues.JBPass1_NumberViolations variable), however, suggests that the participant was responding somewhat randomly and inconsistently. The ABCD consortium Neurocognition Workgroup recommends caution in using data from cases wherein “values.JBPass1_NumberViolations” is greater than 1 or 2.\nPer Johnson and Bickel (2008), values.Consistent_per_JBcriterion2 (yes,no) essentially indicates whether or not the participant discounted delayed rewards at all. JBPass 2 “yes” means that the youth discounted the standard reward (here $100) by at least 10% at the maximum delay interval presented in the task (here 5 years). Assuming a participant was attentive and engaged, a “no” value would suggest that delay had no effect on how the participant valued future rewards. Alternatively, the participant may have adopted a facile, unreflective strategy to respond for the larger reward amount in every trial. Many investigators simply exclude data from participants who do not discount at all. The Neurocognition Workgroup recommends caution using data from cases wherein values.Consistent_per_JBcriterion2 is not “yes.”\nNotes and special considerations:\nUsers should consider restricting data analysis to participants for whom values.Consistent per_JBcriterion1 and values.Consistent per_JBcriterion2 are both “yes.”\nReference: Johnson and Bickel (2008)",

The task-relevant dimension is an emotional word that participants categorized as either a “good” feeling (happy, joyful) or a “bad” feeling (angry, upset). The task-irrelevant dimension is an image, which is of a teenager’s face with either a happy or an angry facial expression. Trials are of two types. On congruent trials, the word and facial emotion are of the same valence (e.g. a happy face paired with word “joyful”). The location of the word varies from trial-to-trial, presented either on the top of the image or at the bottom. On incongruent trials, the word and facial expression are of different valence (e.g., a happy face paired with word “angry”). Participants work through 2 test blocks: one block consists of 50% congruent and 50% incongruent trials; the other consists of 25% incongruent trials and 75% congruent trials. The composition of the former type of block helps individuals keep the task set in mind more so than the latter (Kane and Engle 2003). The 25% incongruent/75% congruent block is always administered first, followed by the 50% incongruent/50% congruent block. Accuracy and response times for congruent versus incongruent trials for the total task and within each emotion subtype (happy/joyful; angry/upset) are calculated. Relative difficulties with cognitive control are indexed by lower accuracy rates and longer reaction times for incongruent relative to congruent trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaction Time\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be aberrant data in the task with reaction times (RTs). We recommend that researchers should use cut-offs to omit RTs &lt; 200 ms and &gt; 2000 ms. The task’s upper limit for issuing a response was 2000ms. End-users might consider downloading trial-wise data and selectively omitting certain outlier trials and recalculating mean RT values.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nBanich (2019)\nBaşgöze et al.

Risk taking is assessed by having participants attempt to predict the outcome of a dice roll by choosing among different options that vary on their outcome probability and pay-off across 18 trials. Specific rules and probabilities for monetary gains and losses are evident throughout the task (Brand et al. 2005). On each trial, participants predict the outcome of a die roll by choosing from four different options (e.g., one number vs. multiple numbers). Options with more numbers (i.e. higher probability of winning) are associated with a lesser reward compared to those with one or two possible numbers (i.e. lower probability of winning). The two options with the lowest probability of winning are considered ‘risky choices.’ The total number of risky choices is often used to quantify performance.\nReferences:\n\nBrand et al.

    "text": "Social Influence Task\n nc_y_sit\nMeasure description: The Social Influence Task (SIT) assesses risk perception and propensity for risk taking, as well as susceptibility to perceived peer influence. Over the course of 40 trials, participants are presented with a variety of risky scenarios. Participants are asked to rate an activity’s risk by moving a slider bar between “very LOW risk” (left) and “very HIGH risk” (right). After submitting an initial rating, participants are shown a risk rating of the same activity that is seemingly provided by a group of peers. This peer rating condition is either 4 points lower (‘-4’ condition), 2 points lower (‘-2’ condition), 2 points higher (‘+2’ condition) or 4 points higher (‘+4’ condition) than the participant’s initial rating. Participants are asked to rate the riskiness of the scenario again. For both the initial and final rating trials, participants have a time limit of 4500 ms to provide their rating.\nThe task is designed to try to ensure ~25% of trials (~10 trials) are in each of the peer rating conditions. To do this, the task script restricts random sampling to only those conditions that can be run given the participant’s initial ratings (e.g., if a participant selected a rating of 1.8, condition -4 and condition -2 cannot be run as both of those conditions would result in a peer rating &lt; 0). If none of the unselected peer conditions can be run due to rating constraints, yet 10 trials have already been run in all the realistic peer conditions, the script uses the ‘switch sign’ method; it (randomly) selects from the unselected peer conditions and then switches the sign (e.g., selected peer condition -4 will be run as peer condition +4 and vice versa). The script tracks how many such switches had to be made.\nThis task was administered at year 4 but discontinued 9/14/2021 based on participant burden and task data showing lack of peer “pull” during the 4-year follow-up (n=~3000).\nReference: Knoll et al.

Detailed scoring processes can also be found in the Toolbox_Scoring_and_Interpretation_Guide_for_iPad_v1.7 here.\nNIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test (Language)\nScoring Process: Item Response Theory (IRT) is used to score the Picture Vocabulary Test. A score known as a theta score is calculated for each participant; it represents the relative overall ability or performance of the participant. A theta score is very similar to a z-score, which is a statistic with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\nNIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test (Language)\nScoring Process: IRT is used to score the Oral Reading Recognition Test. A theta score is calculated for each participant, representing the overall reading ability or performance of the participant. A theta score is similar to a z-score, which is a statistic with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.\nNIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (Executive Function & Attention)\nScoring Process: A 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, where each of these “vectors” ranges in value between 0 and 5, and the computed score, combining each vector score, ranges in value from 0-10. For any given individual, accuracy is considered first. If accuracy levels for the participant are less than or equal to 80%, the final “total” computed score is equal to the accuracy score. If accuracy levels for the participant reach more than 80%, the reaction time score and accuracy score are combined.\nNIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (DCCS) (Executive Function)\nScoring Process: A 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, where each of these “vectors” ranges in value between 0 and 5, and the computed score, combining each vector score, ranges in value from 0-10. For any given individual, accuracy is considered first. If accuracy levels for the participant are less than or equal to 80%, the final “total” computed score is equal to the accuracy score. If accuracy levels for the participant reach more than 80%, the reaction time score and accuracy score are combined.\nNIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test (Episodic Memory)\nScoring Process: The Picture Sequence Memory Test is scored using IRT methodology. The number of adjacent pairs placed correctly for each of trials 1 and 2 is converted to a theta score, which provides a representation of the given participant’s estimated ability in this episodic memory task. All normative standard scores are provided.\nNIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test (Working Memory)\nScoring process: List Sorting is scored by summing the total number of items correctly recalled and sequenced on 1-List and 2-List, which can range from 0-26. This score is then converted to the nationally normed standard scores.\nNIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (Processing Speed)\nScoring process: List Sorting is scored by summing the total number of items correctly recalled and sequenced on 1-List and 2-List, which can range from 0-26. This score is then converted to the nationally normed standard scores. This task is included in the calculation of the Fluid Composite Score: the participant’s raw score is the number of items answered correctly in 85 seconds of response time, with a range of 0-130. This score is then converted to the NIH Toolbox normative standard scores.",

We encourage users to review the NASEM report for consideration of appropriate population descriptors for their analysis. Self-reported race and ethnicity may reflect social and environmental experiences that do not directly correspond to genetic variation. Genetic principal components are provided to more accurately represent genetic variation without reliance on self-reported categories. Principal components provide unlabelled variables capturing genetic variation, whereas ancestry labels capture similar variation but typically are labeled in terms of continental ancestry groups (European, African, etc.).\nTo ensure genetic analyses are conducted with scientific rigor and precision, this data release provides genetic principal components rather than ancestry labels, following best practices in genomic research.\nReference: Using Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics Research: A New Framework for an Evolving Field (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData warning: Genetics principal components\n\n\n\n\n\nOutliers of the genetics principal components appear in the gn_y_popstruct table should be noted and analyzed as such.",

We include gn_y_genrel_id__birth which, for individuals in the same (genetic) family, indicates those whose birthdays are within three months of each other (i.e., twins or triplets). These fields are cross listed in the “ABCD (general)” domain (ab_g_stc__design_id__fam__gen and ab_g_stc__design_id__birth__gen).\ngn_y_genrel_id__fam can be used as a random effect in mixed effects models to account for relatedness in the ABCD sample. Depending on the analysis, users may select either or a combination of these variables to account for familial/shared environmental effects within the sample.\nTwin Analysis Variables: To identify siblings or twins/triplets in the sample, researchers can use gn_y_genrel_id__paired__{N}, gn_y_genrel_zyg__{N} and gn_y_genrel_pihat__{N} columns. These columns are derived from pairs of related individuals where both individuals have been genotyped. These columns are aligned such that for a given subject, gn_y_genrel_id__paired__01 indicates the other subject in the sample they are related to, andgn_y_genrel_zyg__01 indicates whether this relationship is monozygotic (1), dizygotic (2) or singleton siblings (3). Monozygotic relationships have \\(\\hat{\\pi}\\)&gt;0.8, dizygotic relationships have 0.8&gt;\\(\\hat{\\pi}\\)&gt;0.35 and matching birth dates between pairs, and sibling relationships have 0.8&gt;\\(\\hat{\\pi}\\)&gt;0.35 and birth dates more than 3 months apart. Finally, gn_y_genrel_pihat__01 represents the genetic relatedness of this relationship (as captured by \\(\\hat{\\pi}\\) ). These columns are only defined for individuals for pihat &gt;0.35. Genetic relatedness across all pairs in the sample (thresholded) is available as part of the bulk genetic data (see section GENESIS below, which describes how genetic relatedness was calculated).\nModifications since initial administration: From data release 5.0 onwards, genetic relatedness has been computed by PC-Relate (see GENESIS section below for details). Previous data releases used PLINK --genome for this calculation which is less suitable for the population structure of the ABCD study.\nReferences:\n\nGogarten et al.

Based on the best practices analysis workflow by Thermo Fisher, classifications that passed the final SNP quality controls were recommended, resulting in ~515K recommended probe sets in each genotyping batch. Blood and Saliva DNA samples were genotyped separately. We include one genotype result for each subject, using whichever sample has the best QC metrics (call rates and missingness). There were nine genotyping batches in Data Release 6.0, spanning 147 plates (See batch.info in downloaded files). After obtaining the genotype batch, we mapped the probesets to SNPs using annotations derived from genome build hg19. After the mapping, we merged all nine batches into one study cohort and then performed additional study level QC to include missingness less than 10% in the SNP level, and less than 20% in the sample level. 515,279 variants and 11,664 people passed filters and QC. The subsequent imputation and relatedness inferences were based on the final curated genotype data. The batch information can be found in batch.info.

Traditional approaches for calculating PCs (e.g., FlashPCA), although considered best practice for many genetic studies, may not be suited for samples with large known or cryptic relatedness, as is observed in ABCD. As such, we have replaced these genetic PCs with ones calculated using PC-AiR, a method developed and validated for samples with large family structure. PC-AiR captures ancestry information not confounded by relatedness by finding a set of unrelated individuals in the sample that have the highest divergent ancestry, and computing PCs in this set. The remaining related individuals are then projected into this space. This method is used by the Population Architecture through Genomics and Environment (PAGE) Consortium, which is principally concerned with genetic studies in diverse ancestry populations.\nPC-AiR was run using default suggested settings from the GENESIS package. We used non-imputed SNPs passing QCs from the 6.0 data release (~500k variants and 11,664 individuals). PC-AiR takes in kinship estimates for defining its unrelated set of individuals with divergent ancestry; this was computed using snpgdsIBDKING as suggested by GENESIS authors. SNPs were LD pruned using snpgdsLDpruning with parameters: method=“corr”, slide.max.bp=10e6 and ld.threshold=sqrt(0.1). This resulted in 114,707 SNPs remaining after pruning. Using the computed kinship matrix PC-Air was then run on this pruned set of SNPs. This resulted in 8,177 unrelated individuals from which PCs were derived – leaving 3,391 related individuals being projected onto this space. Subsequent analysis indicated a sample mix of 2 samples which were then removed from other genetic data.This is why the sum of unrelated and related individuals is more than the number of individuals in PLINK files (8,177+3,391&gt;1,668). The weights, which can be used to project other samples into the same PC space, can be found in pcair_weights.tsv, with the file /smokescreen/merged_chroms.bim indicating allele codings. The list of 8,177 unrelated individuals used for deriving PC’s is available in unrelateds_individuals.txt.\nAfter Computing PCs from PC-AiR, we then computed a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) using PC-Relate. PC-Relate aims to compute a GRM that is independent from ancestry effects as derived from PC-AiR. PC-Relate was run on the same pruned set of SNPs described above using the first two PCs computed from PC-Air. Identity by descent probabilities between individuals i and j were calculated as \\(\\hat{\\pi}_{ij}= \\hat{k}_{ij}^{(2)}+0.5× \\hat{k}_{ij}^{(1)}\\), where \\(\\hat{k}_{ij}^{(2)}\\) and \\(\\hat{k}_{ij}^{(1)}\\) represent the probabilities that individuals i and j share 2 or 1 alleles at a locus – calculated from PC-Relate. For all off-diagonal elements of the GRM we provide estimates of \\(\\hat{k}_{ij}^{(0)}\\), \\(\\hat{k}_{ij}^{(1)}\\), \\(\\hat{k}_{ij}^{(2)}\\), \\(\\hat{\\pi}_{ij}\\) and genetic relatedness in pcrelate_relatedness.tsv. For a subset of related individuals (\\(\\hat{\\pi}\\)&gt;0.35) we include estimates in tabulated data in the gen_y_genrel instrument described above. Code used to perform the processes described in this section can be found here: https://github.com/robloughnan/ABCD_GeneticPCs_and_Relatedness.\nNumber of individuals: 11,664\nModifications since initial release: Genotyping of missing individuals from previous data releases due to sample mix up or failing quality control measures. Use of PC-Relate for relatedness computation, previous data releases used PLINK --genome for this calculation.\nReferences:\n\nGogarten et al.

Researchers are encouraged to explore how these response types relate to other variables and consider potential impacts on findings. Not accounting for these responses appropriately could introduce bias and compromise validity of results.\nThe table below shows that these response types correlate with other important demographic variables across the first four full study visits (Baseline through Three year follow-up) and the partial four year follow-up visit. For instance, participants from households that responded “Do not know” were disproportionately Hispanic and from households with less than some college education. Participants from households that responded “Decline to answer” were disproportionately White and from households with at least a bachelor’s degree. These responses may reflect contextual, cultural, or social factors, such as who manages household finances or potential language barriers, rather than lack of financial knowledge.\nDistribution of Income Categories and Non-Response Patterns Across Study Visits by Key Demographics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;50K\n≥50K & &lt;100K\n≥100K\nDo not know\nDecline to answer\n\n\nStudy Visit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline (n=11,868)\n3222 (25.2)\n3068 (23.7)\n4561 (23.4)\n504 (25.8)\n511 (25.6)\n\n\n1 year (n=11,220)\n2932 (22.9)\n2940 (22.7)\n4432 (22.8)\n454 (23.3)\n461 (23.1)\n\n\n2 year (n=10,973)\n2859 (22.3)\n2893 (22.3)\n4343 (22.3)\n428 (21.9)\n450 (22.5)\n\n\n3 year (n=10,336)\n2608 (20.4)\n2745 (21.2)\n4193 (21.5)\n391 (20.1)\n399 (20.0)\n\n\n4 year (n=4,754)\n1171 (9.2)\n1300 (10.0)\n1933 (9.9)\n173 (8.9)\n177 (8.9)\n\n\nChild race/ethnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite\n3072 (24.0)\n7686 (59.4)\n14323 (73.6)\n496 (25.4)\n716 (35.8)\n\n\nBlack\n3829 (29.9)\n1298 (10.0)\n708 (3.6)\n502 (25.7)\n472 (23.6)\n\n\nHispanic\n4301 (33.6)\n2540 (19.6)\n1807 (9.3)\n705 (36.2)\n496 (24.8)\n\n\nAsian\n114 (0.9)\n207 (1.6)\n594 (3.1)\n48 (2.5)\n92 (4.6)\n\n\nOther\n1476 (11.5)\n1215 (9.4)\n2027 (10.4)\n199 (10.2)\n222 (11.1)\n\n\nHousehold Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt; HS Diploma\n2004 (15.7)\n245 (1.9)\n23 (0.1)\n531 (27.2)\n182 (9.1)\n\n\nHS Diploma/GED\n2902 (22.7)\n934 (7.2)\n316 (1.6)\n426 (21.8)\n335 (16.8)\n\n\nSome College\n5675 (44.4)\n4717 (36.4)\n2599 (13.4)\n620 (31.8)\n596 (29.8)\n\n\nBachelor\n1524 (11.9)\n4333 (33.5)\n7617 (39.1)\n226 (11.6)\n490 (24.5)\n\n\nPost Graduate Degree\n659 (5.2)\n2717 (21.0)\n8907 (45.8)\n144 (7.4)\n359 (18.0)\n\n\nMarital Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\n4410 (34.5)\n9391 (72.5)\n17538 (90.1)\n850 (43.6)\n1188 (59.5)\n\n\nNo\n8188 (64.0)\n3533 (27.3)\n1916 (9.8)\n1057 (54.2)\n731 (36.6)\n\n\n\nNote: Values in parentheses are percentages calculated within each study visit unless otherwise noted\n*Race/ethnicity of the child was parent-reported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData warning: Household income\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total household income measure in ABCD refers to the “total combined family income for the past 12 months.” The non-summary variable includes the following response options:\n\nLess than $5,000\n$5,000 through $11,999\n$12,000 through $15,999\n$16,000 through $24,999\n$25,000 through $34,999\n$35,000 through $49,999\n$50,000 through $74,999\n$75,000 through $99,999\n$100,000 through $199,999\n$200,000 and greater\n\nAdditionally, two special response categories are included: - 999 = “Don’t know” - 777 = “Decline to answer”\nIn earlier data releases, 999 and 777 responses were coded as missing. As a result, any researcher using the household income variable— for statistical adjustment or as a variable of interest—would have their number of observations reduced by ~10%. More recent releases retained 999 and 777 as distinct levels in the variable rather than coding them as missing.\n** Recommendation for handling 777 and 999 responses**\nInstead of re-coding 777 (“Decline to answer”) and 999 (“Don’t know”) as missing, consider the following strategies:\n\nRetain as distinct values\nKeep 777 and 999 as valid categories. This allows for analysis of their distribution and potential associations with other variables.\nDocument your approach\nClearly describe in your methods how these values were treated, along with the rationale and implications for interpretation.\n\nThese practices help minimize bias and enhance the transparency and validity of research findings.\nReference: Li et al.

A 5-level race/ethnicity variable is included in the dataset, but usage may differ depending on study goals. For example:\n\nIn one paper using ABCD data, race/ethnicity categories included White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other, with racial subgroups identified within the “Other” category (Fadus et al. 2021).\nAnother study used non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American/Alaska Native, Multi-racial, and additional race groups (Barch et al. 2021).\n\nFor guidance on appropriate use of race/ethnicity data, see (Cardenas-Iniguez et al. 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsible use warning: Family relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nab_g_stc__design_id__fam__gen\nThis variable indicates participants who were enrolled with the same guardian (i.e. siblings) at the baseline visit.

The report emphasizes that terms such as “race”—whether self-identified or otherwise—do not adequately represent the full continuum of human genetic diversity and should not be used as proxies for genetic variation.\nThe data release includes genetic principal components (PCs) of ancestry, which are unlabeled variables that capture genetic variation. It does not include genetic ancestry factors, which label variation in terms of continental groupings (e.g., European, African, Asian).\nBates, Chin, and Becker (2022)",

Items use a 5-point Likert scale, from strongly agree to strongly disagree, or very likely to very unlikely, some of which are reverse scored, to generate two subscales (Community Cohesion and Community Control) and an overall summary score (Collective Efficacy). Questions on Community Cohesion focus on trust in a community (e.g., “This is a close-knit neighborhood;” “People in this neighborhood can be trusted”). Items that contribute to the Community Control subscale reflect neighbors’ willingness to intervene (e.g., “If there was a fight in front of your house and someone was being beaten or threatened, how likely is it that your neighbors would break it up?”).\nNotes and special considerations: Based on recommendations by the developers, a “Don’t know” response is converted to a 3 (“Neither agree nor disagree”) in the subscale mean scores. Due to the inclusion of “Don’t Know” responses into the subscale mean scores, “Don’t Know” responses are coded as “99” at the item level instead of “999.” Over 5% of caregivers chose “Don’t know” for multiple items across the waves.\nBased on information collected from our Audience Feedback groups and investigator input, the PhenX Community Cohesion subscale was discontinued after the 6-year follow-up.\nReference: National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (1994)",

This scale is a modified version of the scale developed in Stattin and Kerr (2000), provided to the ABCD Study by Stattin.\nNotes and special considerations: The response scales of the constituent items go from high to low rather than low to high. As a result, HIGHER scores on the summary variable at present indicate less knowledge, not more.\nThe item response scales differ across the items being averaged - some items have a response scale with 5 options, some with 4 options, some with 2 options. This impacts the creation and interpretation of the summary score.\nFor variable: fc_p_pk__knowl_007 (“Do you know which places your child visits when they are out with friends at night?”). A notably larger percentage of parents choose “decline to answer” as their response to this question than the percentage of parents who do so for other items on this scale. The percentage of “decline to answer” responses decreases longitudinally, which might indicate that parents were selecting “decline to answer” because they do not allow their children to be out with friends at night at younger ages - in other words, they see the question as inapplicable. We cannot confirm this possibility, but bring the larger percentage of “decline to answer” responses to users’ attention when considering a summary score.\nFor variable: fc_p_pk__badreact_001 (“Do you avoid taking up certain issues with your child due to bad experiences, e.g. how the child reacted earlier?”) should not be combined with the other items into a summary score. Rather than asking about how much parents know, like the other items, this variable asks if parents avoid taking up certain issues with the youth due to the youth having reacted negatively in the past.\nReference: Stattin and Kerr (2000)",

As such, if participants reported a maximum score on the PDS for two years in a row, then the PDS was discontinued.\n\nYears 2-5 PDS collection was impacted by the pandemic, with the largest proportion of missingness in Year 3. Researchers will want to examine sample biases, particularly in Year 3, when using PDS scores. Occasionally, responses may indicate inconsistent developmental patterns, including apparent reversals in pubertal development stages based on parent or youth reports. Researchers should carefully examine these instances when interpreting data.. We have opted not to modify this data, but will leave it up to the user to make an informed decision on how to handle these variances in the parent or youth reports.

See also sexuality items in the Youth KSADS Background Items Survey. KBI items are duplicated into this table, with keyword __kbi for easier reference. The two measures may be used together for longitudinal analysis, with careful consideration for how item context, phrasing, and response options have changed over time.\nPart way through the 3-year follow-up data collection, the Sexual Behavior Survey was updated such that “boyfriend or girlfriend” was changed to “romantic relationship (like a boyfriend or girlfriend)”. Response options to attraction and partner characteristics were changed from multiple choice to “check all that apply”\nAt the 4-year follow-up, conversations with parents about sex were added (3 items covering abstinence/waiting to have sex, safe sex practices, or other sex topics adapted from the approach validated by Sales et al. (2008)).\nAt the 5-year follow-up, items assessing sexual activity were branched off a single gating item (ph_y_sex__beh_003). The gating question was only populated for youth who endorsed ph_y_sex__beh_002a and/or ph_y_sex__beh_002b. Additional questions ask about type of sexual activity with more branching for each type of activity to assess number of partners and safe sex practices, adapted from the Healthy Passages study of adolescent health Windle et al. (2004).\nNotes and special considerations:\nBetween November 2021- March 2022, some behavior items were inadvertently not administered at the Medical University of South Carolina (5) and the survey was temporarily not administered at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research (4) due to administrative issues; data are missing in these cases.\nIn March 2022, some changes were made to instructions and order of some sections to reduce ambiguity; no item content was changed. Changes included: Expanding the preamble to better describe the domains covered by the survey and to note that some of the questions are very personal; shortening the introduction to the behavior questions to just “The next questions are about your behavior. They are only about people who are not related to you.” and moving behavior items to immediately follow attraction and precede relationship items.\nSome items in the Youth Sexual Behavior Survey have parent-reported counterparts (See table below)\n\n\n\nMulti-informant\n\n\n\nYouth SBS\nParent GSBS\n\n\nph_y_sex__cnvs_001\nph_p_sex__cnvs_001\n\n\nph_y_sex__cnvs_002\nph_p_sex__cnvs_002\n\n\nph_y_sex__cnvs_003\nph_p_sex__cnvs_003\n\n\n\nYouth sexual orientation is assessed within the Youth KSADS Background Items (see Measure description below), noted in the data dictionary by the keyword kbi_.

Users may use these measurements to calculate body mass index (BMI), BMI z-scores, and percentiles using reference data from the CDC or WHO. Users should be aware of the challenges associated with BMI as a measure, highlighted by the American Medical Association. BMI is a proxy for body fat mass and may not accurately represent risk of metabolic disease or other conditions. While waist circumference may be a better predictor of health risk, good reference data for waist circumference in children do not yet exist.\nFor children, historical reference cut-offs for weight categories (e.g., CDC, WHO) may not accurately represent current norms or risk profiles across diverse populations. Users should consider this limitation when interpreting BMI z-scores or percentiles.(e.g., in longitudinal research questions, see for a larger discussion); BMI z-score difference scores may lead to erroneous conclusions.\nAdise et al. (2024) reviews the methodology used to create reference growth curves and discusses the appropriate use of reference pediatric BMI growth curves within the context of cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in research. It also provides recommendations around how to select metrics based on desired evaluations.\n(https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/ama-use-bmi-alone-imperfect-clinical-measure)\n\nThis is a link to the AMA statement on the limitations of BMI as a measurement and recommendations for future studies.\nAMA advises caution when using BMI alone, as original BMI norms were based on populations that may not represent all individuals equally and did not account for varying body compositions or health risks across diverse populations.\n\n\n\n\nMeasure description: Measurements of height, weight, waist circumference.\nRecommendation on how to calculate a summary score is below:\n\nif exactly one measurement is available, do not compute a mean. Use the single measurement in your analysis\nif exactly two measurements are available, compute the mean over the two measurements\nif exactly three measurements are available, compute the mean over the two closest measurements among the three\nAn average score (Summary score) will now be available for each participant in the data release based on the recommendations provided above.\n\nWhen tracking change in weight status over time, consider which calculated variable is most appropriate/valid for this purpose. See linked manuscript (which was also referenced above) for a discussion regarding use of BMI z-score, BMI percentiles, and BMI controlling for sex and age (Adise et al. 2024)\nNotes and special considerations: Starting in March 2020, for remote visits, self-reported estimates of height and weight were obtained from the participant or parent/caregiver. Estimates for waist circumference were not obtained. Variable name ab_g_dyn__visit_type can indicate if the visit was “remote” or “hybrid” (some components of the visit were completed in person with RA measurement and some remotely). All height and weight data from “remote” visits were estimated values provided by the parent or participant. Hybrid visits should have included measured heights and weights, but this cannot be confirmed. Some height and weight data provided during a hybrid visit might have been self-reported. Given the variability of estimated heights and weights, data from a remote or hybrid visit should be used judiciously.\nReferences:\n\n (2021)\nAdise et al. (2024)\nBerg (2023)",

Blood was shipped and processed at either frozen or ambient temperature until September 2023, after which it was only shipped at ambient temperature. CBC analysis is only performed on ambient temperature whole blood, while all other panels are performed on either ambient or frozen samples. Analysis sponsored by the NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.\nBlood samples were scheduled to be collected at the 2-year, 4-year, and 6-year follow-up visits. If a participant missed the blood draw during one of these timepoints—or if the sample was insufficient for any reason—they were asked to provide a sample at the next available odd-numbered year visit. As a result, some participants contributed blood samples during odd-year follow-ups to compensate for a missed or unusable sample from the corresponding even-year visit.\nModifications since initial administration: In September 2022, a 2 ml tube of blood collection was added to increase the ease of lab testing.\nIn September 2023, all blood was shipped at ambient temperature, with a cold pack and mylar sleeve to maintain optimal temperature conditions, but not frozen.\nNotes and special considerations: For collections prior to September 2022:\n\n10 mL purple top EDTA tube is used for CBC with differential (if ambient), HbA1c, DNA extraction, and aliquots for future use (Tube 2)\n10 mL red/tiger top SST tube (transferred into 6ml FluidX tube after processing) is used for the lipid panel (total and HDL cholesterol), ferritin, and aliquots for future use (Tube 1)\n\nFor collections since September 2022:\n\n2mL purple top EDTA is used for CBC with differential (if ambient) and HbA1c and sent directly to processing lab (Tube 3)\n10 mL purple top EDTA tube is used for DNA extraction and aliquots for future use.

Researchers should be cautious when analyzing results in light of this variance.\n\n\n\nTest completion date-timestamps are only available for samples analyzed after September 2021.\nAs of August 18, 2023, all blood samples were shipped within 72 hours of collection, and CBC analysis only performed if received within 48 hours of collection.\nInformation on genetics results from blood can be found in the Genetics Release Notes.",

As such, if participants reported a maximum score on the PDS for two years in a row, the PDS was not administered.\n\nYears 2-5 PDS collection was impacted by the pandemic, with peak missingness in Year 3. Researchers will want to examine sample biases, particularly in Year 3, when using PDS scores. Occasionally, responses may indicate inconsistent developmental patterns, including apparent reversals in pubertal development stages based on parent or youth reports. Researchers should carefully examine these instances when interpreting data. We have opted not to modify this data, but will leave it up to the user to make an informed decision on how to handle these variances in the parent or youth reports. Articles referenced below will provide additional details on how to handle these variables.\nResearchers can find more details on pubertal development scale data, methods, meaningful covariates and decision-making for determining final analytical sample in Cheng et al.

This project assesses how natural disasters affect neurobiology, cognition, and mood. Natural disasters are disruptive and affect millions of people worldwide each year, including children. Disaster experiences are associated with youth feeling vulnerable and experiencing problems at school, at home, and with peers, as well as problems with mental health and substance use. This research also examines how pre-disaster brain functioning and thinking may protect against some of the effects of disaster-related stress on youth.\nIn the year before Hurricane Irma’s landfall, a large sample of children in Florida and South Carolina–who were later affected by the hurricane–began participating in a large, multisite longitudinal investigation of brain and cognitive development, the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Also studied was a large sample of control children in California, who were not affected by the hurricane. The sub-study takes advantage of data collected prior to the hurricane in the ABCD study, which used a battery of neuropsychological, interview, genetic, and structural and functional neuroimaging tests. Because disasters are rarely predictable, most prior studies of the effects of disaster exposure do not have access to important information about research participants’ pre-disaster statuses or levels of functioning; the prospective design of the current research avoids this problem. By studying children’s Irma-related experiences, traumatic exposure, and evacuation-related stress, this study affords a unique opportunity to longitudinally examine the effects of disaster exposure and disaster-related stress on youth development.\n\n\n\nYouth table\n irma_y_qtn\nHurricane exposure: Youth participants completed the Hurricane Related Traumatic Experiences–II (HURTE-II), an updated iteration of the HURTE-R (Vernberg et al. (1996); La Greca et al. (2010)), which has been used extensively in hurricane research to assess hurricane exposure and postdisaster stressors. The HURTE-II assesses stressors before (e.g., evacuation experiences), during (e.g., perceived life threat, actual life threat, immediate loss/disruption), and ongoing stress, loss, and disruption after the storm. An Irma-related media exposure questionnaire was also developed. We also included items assessing parental regulation of children’s Irma-related media exposure, as well as patterns of household discussions surrounding the hurricane. The latter items were drawn from previous research on the differential effects of varied household discussions in the aftermath of disasters (Carpenter et al. (2017)).\nPerceived stress: Youth completed the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein (1983)), the most widely used assessment of subjectively experienced stress.

    "text": "MRI Processed Data\nThe ABCD Data Release 6.0 contains minimally processed neuroimaging data for ABCD Study participants, including:\n\nHigh-resolution structural data (3D T1w and T2w scans)\nAdvanced diffusion MRI (multiple b-values and directions)\nResting State fMRI\nTask fMRI (Monetary Incentive Delay, Stop-Signal, and Emotional N-Back) with event files for each fMRI run\n\nThese series have been run through standard modality-specific pre-processing stages including conversion from raw to compressed files, distortion correction, movement correction, alignment to standard space, and initial quality control (refer to the MRI Quality Control release notes). This is to enable researchers to use the ABCD neuroimaging data in their own processing pipelines more quickly and efficiently than starting with raw data. Note that minimal processing is identical for rs-fMRI and task-fMRI and does not include analysis-specific pre-processing steps (e.g. removal of initial TRs, normalization by mean, etc.).\nPreprocessed imaging data are packaged in a “derivatives” BIDS directory structure with NIfTI format data files (consistent with BIDS specifications version 1.9.0: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Imaging metadata derived from the original DICOM files are packaged along with each preprocessed data series as JSON files. The minimally processed T2w data are resampled into voxel-wise alignment with the T1w, which is rigid-body resampled into alignment with a standardized anatomical atlas.\ndMRI-specific information included diffusion gradients adjusted for head rotation (bvecs.txt), diffusion gradient strengths (bvals.txt), and a rigid-body transformation matrix specifying the registration between the dMRI image and the corresponding processed sMRI T1w image (stored in the JSON file). The dMRI minimally processed data are also kept in their original resolution, but reoriented into a standard alignment, based on registration to T1w, but not voxel-wise aligned with the T1w. A registration matrix is supplied with the minimally processed dMRI data.\nfMRI-specific information includes estimated motion time courses and a rigid-body transformation matrix specifying the registration between the fMRI image and the T1w image (stored in the JSON file). The fMRI minimally processed data are kept in their original space and resolution, but a registration matrix is supplied with the minimally processed fMRI data. For task-fMRI series, event timing information is included as tab-separated value (.tsv) files. The results of additional processing and ROI analysis are shared in tabulated form (see here).\nInformation about this is included in the modality-specific data documentation notes and in Hagler et al. (2019). They also describe what processing steps are included in the “minimally processed” data.\nA containerized version of the ABCD processing pipeline will become available as a Docker or singularity image (location of docker/singularity).\n\n\nFreeSurfer\nThe ABCD Data Release 6.0 contains the complete FreeSurfer output directories for ABCD Study participants. FreeSurfer segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction was performed using FreeSurfer version 7.1.1 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) using preprocessed T1-weighted volumes as input. To maintain compatibility with standard FreeSurfer tools, FreeSurfer outputs are provided without renaming files to meet BIDS standards and directories are arranged in a flat structure (with names like sub-XXXX_ses-XXXX), rather than the standard hierarchical BIDS directory structure (sub-XXXX/ses-XXXX).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional notes\n\n\n\nThe MRI Derivatives Data included with ABCD Data Release 6.0 is packaged in a BIDS-compliant derivatives structure. Note that derivatives were not generated directly from source and raw BIDS data (see MRI Raw Data File Sharing Data Documentation). Instead, source and raw BIDS are a repackaging / conversion of the data that is supplied to the ABCD processing pipeline. The derivatives are a repackaging of the outputs of the processing pipeline. Future versions of the ABCD processing pipeline will work directly with the raw data BIDS to avoid potential inconsistencies and for better reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHagler, Donald J., SeanN.

It creates brain-wide artifactual effects including elevated short-distance connectivity and attenuated long-distance connectivity (Power et al. 2012). In order to guard against artifactual effects due to head motion, researchers typically implement a variety of strategies that operate at multiple points of the data collection and processing pipeline, with guidance regularly evolving over time (Power et al. 2014; Power, Schlaggar, and Petersen 2015; Satterthwaite et al. 2013; Siegel et al. 2017; Gratton et al. 2020). Some of these strategies include discarding entire runs of data that exceed certain motion thresholds and discarding individual functional imaging frames that are proximal to motion events (i.e., “motion censoring”). These strategies in particular typically lead to the exclusion of some participants from further analysis for lack of sufficient data. Levels of head motion differ according to demographic factors such as sex, race/ethnicity, and SES (Cosgrove et al. 2022). Therefore, strategies to deal with head motion may lead to differential exclusions across demographic groups. In addition, data quality procedures cause sessions to vary by the amount of data remaining. Such variability may continue to inflate findings especially in the presence of conditions that may correlate with the motion artifact like autism or ADHD (Eggebrecht et al. 2017). One strategy that avoids this confound is to strictly control the degrees of freedom, where functional connectivity measures are calculated with the exact same amount of data. To aid researchers in exploring this impact further, the ABCD study has released 5 minute- and 10 minute-trimmed and untrimmed functional connectivity datasets. Researchers interested in examining brain-behavior associations or multivariate predictions should follow strategies such as those in Eggebrecht et al.

    "section": "Concerns regarding ABCD SST task",
    "text": "Concerns regarding ABCD SST task\nA number of concerns regarding the ABCD STOP task have been raised (see (Bissett et al. 2020)). One is a coding error wherein a fast response (&lt; 50 msec) made when the Stop Signal Delay (SSD) was 50 msec results in all subsequent Stop trials recording this same fast response. This error disrupts the functioning of the SSD tracking algorithm. Although useful data (before the occurrence of the coding error) may be retrievable for many of these participants, we identify for possible exclusion all participants with this coding error (variable mr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__coderr_indicator).\nA second concern relates to the Go stimuli not being presented on trials in which the SSD was 0 msec. On these trials, participants saw only the Stop signal (up arrow) which may have created confusion for participants. Across the full sample of participants, the impact of these occasional trials appears to be minimal for both the Stop Signal Reaction Time calculation and brain activation. However, we now provide a count of 0ms SSD trials per participant (variable mr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__stop__0ssd_count) which investigators can use to set a threshold for excluding participants, if desired.\nFinally, in accordance with race model assumptions and best practices (Verbruggen et al. 2019), the Stop Signal Reaction Time should not be estimated for participants whose Stop Fail RT &gt; Go RT. These participants are identified by the variable mr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__violat_indicator. However, there is no compelling reason to exclude these participants from brain activation analyses unless researchers believe that doing so is warranted given the neuroimaging measurements they are investigating or given their specific research question.\nMore details on these matters are provided in the Trial Level Behavioral Data Documentation. The ABCD team has conducted analyses addressing these matters (Garavan et al. 2020) and concludes that while the concerns have legitimacy, there is little evidence that they have an actual impact on the task reaction time and fMRI data. While we await further empirical data addressing these matters we believe researchers can use these data with confidence. However, we do encourage researchers to carefully evaluate any impact that these concerns may have on their specific analyses.\nVariable names for the indicator flags\n\nmr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__violat_indicator: Race model violators where Stop Fail RT &gt; Go RT\nmr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__coderr_indicator: Task coding error\nmr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__stop__0ssd_count: Number of Stop trials with 0ms SSD",

For the integration method calculation, any Go RT omissions were replaced with the longest Go RT for that participant. In addition, premature responses on Stop trials (i.e., choice responses made before the Stop signal was presented) were included when calculating the participant’s probability of successful stopping and the SSD’s on these trials were included in calculating the average SSD.\nVariable names for SSRT\n\nmr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__ssrt_mean: Stop Signal Reaction Time, mean estimation\nmr_y_tfmri__sst__beh__ssrt_intgr: Stop Signal Reaction Time, integration estimation",

Standard correction methods, such as those used by FreeSurfer, are limited when compensating for steep spatial intensity variation, leading to inaccurate brain segmentation or cortical surface reconstruction. For example, brain tissue farther from the coils, such as the temporal and frontal poles, typically have lower intensity values resulting in focal underestimation of the white matter surface or the elimination of large pieces of the cortical surface reconstruction. Furthermore, brain tissue close to coils with extremely high intensity values may be mistaken for non-brain tissue (e.g., scalp). To overcome this, the ABCD minimally processed structural MRI (sMRI) files include an improved intensity inhomogeneity correction, using a smoothly varying bias field optimized to standardize image intensities within all white matter voxels.",

    "section": "Automated Quality Assurance",
    "text": "Automated Quality Assurance\nThe following are automated metrics for evaluating data quality of processed structural and functional data. Structural metrics reflect registration and acquisition quality while assessment of functional data quality concerns issues with BOLD acquisitions only, including motion and signal.\nPopulation-based assessment is included as well via outlier detection for both structural and functional metrics. This was done in part because functional population-based metrics may pick up on anatomical issues due to the pipeline’s dependency on good anatomical data. Therefore, for cortical thickness/surface-based analyses, investigators using the data will find it useful to examine how many measures are outliers for a given subject (e.g. out of 352 ROIs, volume is an outlier for X number of ROIs).\n\nStructural and Functional Metrics & QA Requirements\nThe following metrics are quantified for each BOLD image/run. Overall QA (PASS or FAIL) is then assessed for an image based on whether they meet the requirements described below for both structural and functional metrics.\nStructural: Brain Coverage\nBrain coverage quantifies the proportion of BOLD acquisition cut off compared to the brain mask in both (1) ventral/inferior and (2) dorsal/superior planes. To receive a PASS for structural QA, there must be less than 10% cutoff in BOTH planes.\nFunctional: Presence of parcellated connectivity matrices for each parcellation scheme\nThis metric marks whether the data includes pconns derived from 5 and 10 minutes of functional data after correcting for motion using a frame displacement threshold of 0.2 mm (Power et al. 2012), serving as a quick indicator of whether there is a sufficient amount of low-motion data present after motion correction. To receive a PASS for functional QA, a concatenated dense time series must have enough low-motion data to generate pconn files from 5 and/or 10 minutes of data.\n\n\nPopulation-Based Outlier Detection\nIn addition to the metrics mentioned above, we also perform outlier detection to quantify the number of structural and functional outliers for each subject session, defined for any given measure as those falling more than 3 standard deviations from the population mean.\nStructural measures: number of outliers in (1) subcortical segmentation volume sizes and (2) cortical morphometry split by regions of interest\nFunctional measures: number of outliers in connectivity matrices for both (1) 5 minutes and (2) 10 minutes of data post-motion correction\n\n\nAdditional QA Columns Added to sessions.tsv\nThe following columns are added to each sessions.tsv for Structural QA:\n\nbc_(task)_run-(run_num): Pass/Fail is determined based on a 10% cutoff of the percentage bold coverage.\nbc_(task)_run-(run_num)_perc_vox: percentage of brain coverage which is used for determining Pass/Fail above.\n#subcortical_segmentation_vol_out(n=22): Number of outliers for subcortical segmentation volume sizes.\n#cortical_morphometry_sulc_out(n=333): Number of outliers for cortical morphometry.\n\nFollowing columns are added to sessions.tsv for Functional QA:\n\n5min_pconn_&lt;atlas&gt;: Pass/Fail is determined based on whether the pconn files from 5 mins of data get produced.\n10min_pconn_&lt;atlas&gt;: Pass/Fail is determined based on whether the pconn files from 10 mins of data get produced.\n#pconn_out_5min_&lt;atlas&gt; (n=61776): Number of outliers for 5 minutes pconn\n#pconn_out_10min_&lt;atlas&gt; (n=61776): Numbers of outliers for 10 minutes pconn\n\nHere, ‘n’ indicates the total number of ROIs/observations used to calculate these outliers and &lt;atlas&gt; refers to the parcellation scheme (including Gordon2014FreeSurferSubcortical, HCP2016FreeSurferSubcortical, Markov2012FreeSurferSubcortical, Power2011FreeSurferSubcortical, and Yeo2011FreeSurferSubcortical).  Note - With the exception of 5min_pconn and 10min_pconn, columns that have 888 indicate that the specific file is missing and not generated.\n\n\nDiffusion Quality Assurance\nAutomated quality control (QC) metrics are included in the QSIPrep derivatives provided in the current release. These metrics are described in detail in the QSIPrep documentation.\nEach diffusion output image is accompanied by a single-line TSV file named desc-image_qc.tsv, which is especially helpful for comparing image quality across participants before selecting data for group-level analyses. The file includes a variety of QC metrics derived primarily from DSI Studio’s QC calculations as described in Yeh et al. (2019):\n\nRaw data metrics (prefixed with raw_):\n\nQuality metrics computed on the diffusion data before preprocessing.\n\nPreprocessed data metrics:\n\nt1_-prefixed columns: QC metrics calculated in the subject’s T1w (native anatomical) space.\nmni_-prefixed columns: QC metrics calculated in standard MNI space.\n\nMotion summary metrics:\n\nmean_fd: Mean framewise displacement.\nmax_fd: Maximum framewise displacement.\nmax_translation: Maximum absolute translation.\nmax_rotation: Maximum absolute rotation.\nmax_rel_translation: Maximum of the derivative of translation (i.e., frame-to-frame change).\nmax_rel_rotation: Maximum of the derivative of rotation.\n\nRegistration quality metrics:\n\nt1_dice_distance: Dice distance between the anatomical brain mask and the DWI brain mask in T1w space.\nmni_dice_distance: Dice distance in MNI space.\n\n\nThese metrics provide a comprehensive summary of image quality and preprocessing accuracy, facilitating informed inclusion/exclusion decisions for downstream analyses.",

    "section": "MID task design and time series modeling",
    "text": "MID task design and time series modeling\nThe Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task used in ABCD was designed to optimize detection of incentive-anticipatory related activation. To minimize scan duration for research participants, a brief version of the MID task with no variable interval between trials was employed. A consequence of this design is that activation associated with the presentation of the trial feedback may contain some signal stemming from anticipation-related processes. This results in certain feedback contrasts (e.g., large win hit minus neutral hit) being potentially unreliable. Users are encouraged to use contrasts that might provide a closer match on anticipation (e.g., large win hit minus large win miss), and this is what is included in data releases. A second issue is that the task has been analyzed using an approach that is common in the literature, in which only anticipatory cues and feedback notifications are modeled, leaving some trial components (post-cue fixation and probe) unmodeled and thus serving as an implicit baseline. We therefore also caution that some component of anticipatory or feedback-related activation may contain non-specific motor-behavior related signal. Similarly, response times to each target have not been modeled (as suggested by Mumford et al. (2023)). As response times differ between hit and miss trials, recent analyses suggest that nonspecific, behaviorally-driven effects may bias estimates of feedback-related activity. More details on the task design and best practices for its analysis will be described in a forthcoming manuscript. Pending additional analyses in partnership with external data end-users, ABCD may in future releases offer MID task data wherein all trial components as well as target response times are modeled.",

In cases where the discrepancy was either 0.8, 1.6, or 2.4 seconds (or within 0.01 seconds of those values), indicating missed (undetected) trigger pulses (~3% of runs), the start time (used as the reference for subsequent events) can be adjusted by simply subtracting the discrepancy. Any other runs that had a start time discrepancy larger than 0.5 seconds (~6% of runs) are excluded from the current task fMRI analysis pipeline, as such cases reflect irregular trigger timing and can make it difficult or impossible to be sure when the stimulus run started relative to the imaging scan. In cases matching specific trigger timing patterns, it may be possible to infer the correct timing offset, so some of these cases may be salvaged in future releases.",

    "text": "Mismatched E-Prime output files and imaging data\nThe task fMRI behavioral and stimulus timing files, which are exported from the E-Prime stimulus presentation program, have a date and time stamp recording when the stimulus program was started for a particular task run. E-Prime timing is compared to date and time derived from imaging DICOM metadata to identify events with potentially mismatched E-Prime file and imaging data. In some cases, these mismatches are due to clock offsets on stimulus computers relative to the MRI console computer; e.g., on days of transition to and from Daylight Saving Time (DST), or small, fixed differences in clock time. In other cases, imaging sites uploaded E-Prime files for one participant but assigned them to a different pGUID, which can result in very large timing differences.

    "text": "Irregular acquisitions\nIn a small percentage of participant-events (&lt; 2%), the number of scans acquired and the number of task runs documented in E-Prime output files differed, leading to potential ambiguity in the assignment of stimulus runs to imaging scan. To prevent matching a stimulus run to the wrong scan and using an incorrect stimulus event time series in the GLM analysis of the imaging data, the task fMRI GLM analysis is currently skipped for participant-events with an irregular acquisition, resulting in missing derived values in the task fMRI tabulated data and missing minimally processed data. Examples of irregular acquisitions creating potential ambiguity include the collection of 3 scans but only 2 stimulus runs, or 1 scan but 2 stimulus runs. This sometimes occurs because a scan was aborted at the participant’s request. The correct mapping between scan and run can sometimes be ascertained with information about all scans collected and which of those were aborted. However, variation and special cases can make it difficult to fashion general rules that work correctly for all.\nIn a very small number of participant-events (&lt; 0.1%), the research assistant or scan operator used the wrong scan protocol for the first of two runs; e.g., using the MID scan protocol while using the SST stimulus. Because the length of the scans differs for the different tasks, mismatched scans and tasks are not analyzed. The second scan of the mismatched pair can be correctly analyzed if assigned to the second stimulus run. These situations were identified as having only one scan of a given task that was immediately preceded by a scan of a different task instead of a field map scan.\nFor approximately 2.0-2.4% of participant-events, only a single imaging scan was available for analysis for one or more tasks, either because only one scan was acquired for that task, one of two scans was aborted during acquisition, or one of two scans failed raw QC. For the SST, if only the second scan was analyzed, these tfMRI data are currently assigned to run1 variables in the tabulated data releases. For the MID and EN-back, if there were errors with run1 scans, neither scan1 or scan2 task fMRI data were analyzed. If there were no issues with the first scan, these data were analyzed.",

    "text": "Task fMRI outliers\nSome participants exhibit frequent periods of motion, and depending on when supra-threshold head movements (FD&gt;0.9 mm) occur relative to instances of a given event type, some conditions may be under-represented. In rare cases, this results in extreme values for the beta and SEM estimates, as much as several orders of magnitude different from typical values for a given contrast. The presence of extreme outliers violates standard parametric assumptions, so group-level statistical analyses would produce invalid and nonsensical results. To prevent this, we censor the beta and SEM values if they are identified as having extremely high SEM values and therefore low reliability beta estimates (see Hagler et al., 2019). We censor the beta and SEM values for all ROIs for those contrasts that have RMS of SEM values across the cortical surface greater than 5% signal change. This represents less than 0.5% of all participant-task- contrast-run combinations. The censored values are replaced with empty cells in the tabulated data as well as the concatenated vertexwise data; however, censoring of outlier contrast-runs was not applied to the concatenated voxelwise data (see Concatenated Imaging Data Documentation). Despite this censoring, some outlier beta values (defined as being outside the mean ± 3 x standard deviation) remain. These cases are more likely to have outliers in a limited number of ROIs, and are possibly related to image quality issues not detected in raw or post-processing manual QC.\nUsers of the task fMRI tabulated or concatenated data are advised to examine outliers in the data and choose inclusion criteria that are appropriate for their analyses. We have provided a set of recommended inclusion criteria for each modality that take into account factors such as imaging QC, task performance, etc. (see MRI Quality Control & Recommended Image Inclusion Criteria release note), and for convenience, we provide a data structure with modality-specific imaging inclusion flags based on those criteria mr_y_qc__incl. However, these recommended inclusion criteria do not account for outliers. It is recommended that users apply methods for handling outliers prior to statistical analysis. For example, inverse rank normalization or winsorizing.\nAdditional references:\n\nChang and Fitzpatrick (1992)\nMorgan et al. (2004)",

(2020) raised several concerns about the design and data recording procedures of the ABCD SST. Trial-level data users are encouraged to read this manuscript, as well as our response Garavan et al. (2020)), and the outline (see Appendix A below) of how each identified concern affects the trial-level data in this release. Two of the concerns raised have particularly important implications for the inclusion of individual subjects:\n\nThe fact that a subset of individuals display response time (RT) data that cannot be explained by the standard SST Independent Race Model (mean failed STOP RT &gt; mean GO RT)\nA data recording glitch, which occurs when a participant makes a fast (&lt;50ms) response on a STOP trial with a 50ms stop-signal delay and which causes all subsequent STOP trials to be incorrectly recorded as failures to stop with the same RT, altering the tracking algorithm. Therefore, in addition to the standard ABCD performance exclusion criteria outlined above, users interested in applying race models of inhibition to the trial-level data are encouraged to exclude participants from analysis who have the following flags:\n\n\nParticipants with mean STOP RT &gt; mean GO RT, indicating clear violations of Independent Race Model assumptions (tfmri_sst_beh_violatorflag)\nParticipants who display evidence of the recording glitch, as outlined in Appendix A (tfmri_sst_beh_glitchflag)\n\nHowever, if users are primarily interested in analyzing features of performance on the GO choice task (e.g., GO RT variability), such exclusions may not be necessary.\nTask trials involved the presentation of stimuli on several different slides in E-Prime: GO trials involved the presentation of a “go” slide with the choice stimulus for 1000ms, or until a participant responded, followed by a “fix” slide which presented a fixation cross for the remaining duration of the 1000ms trial and jittered intertrial interval; STOP trials involved the presentation of a “ssd” slide with the choice stimulus for the duration of the variable stop-signal delay on that trial, followed by a “stopsignal” slide that presented the stop signal (upward facing arrow) for 300ms, and finally by a “fix” slide which presented a fixation cross for the remaining duration of the 1000ms trial plus the duration of the jittered intertrial interval. The recording of RTs and responses was linked to the individual slide, rather than being locked to the onset of the trial.\nTo facilitate use of the trial-level data, the ABCD trial-level behavioral data (TLBD) task force applied minimal pre-processing steps (outlined in Appendix B) to determine the first response a participant made on each trial (sst_primaryresp variable), which in standard research contexts is treated as the participant’s main response, and accurately estimates the RT for this response (sst_primaryresp variable). However, all relevant response, RT and onset timing variables from the individual slides have been retained, as described below, which will allow other researchers to compute response and RT variables using their own methods, if desired.\nWhen possible, participants who were unable to complete the task in the scanner, completed the task behaviorally outside the scanner on a laptop computer. Whether a participant performed the SST in the scanner or on a laptop is indicated by the following variable in the main tabulated data: mr_y_adm__nts__tfmri__sst_indicator. For more details, see the MRI Scanning Checklist and Notes instrument.\n\n\nAppendix A\nDetails on the specific issues raised in the “Cautionary Note” manuscript by Bisset et al, and how they affect the use of these trial-level data.\nAs noted above, a manuscript entitled “A cautionary note on stop-signal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] study” (Bissett et al. (2020)) raised several concerns about the ABCD SST’s design and data recording procedures. Users of the trial-level data are encouraged to read this manuscript and any associated commentaries prior to analyzing these data. For clarity, this section provides a brief summary of each concern and the specific implications that these concerns present for analysis of the trial-level data included in this release.\n1. Different “go” choice stimulus presentation durations across trials.\nSummary:\nOn GO trials, the choice stimulus (a right- or left-facing arrow) is presented on screen until the participant responds or until a 1000ms window passes, whichever occurs first. However, on STOP trials, the visual stop signal (an upward facing arrow) replaces the “go” choice stimulus following the stop-signal delay. This causes the presentation time of the choice stimulus to be substantially shorter, on average, for STOP trials than for GO trials, which likely makes the choice task more difficult in the STOP condition. The increase in difficulty likely yields slower and less accurate choice responses in this condition (particularly for STOP trials with relative short stop-signal delays). The Independent Race Model, which is the dominant framework for estimating the main index of inhibition on the SST (stop-signal reaction time; SSRT) assumes context independence, which means that the “go” choice process and its average finishing time are not affected by the presentation of the stop signal (i.e., that the “go” process is identical between GO and STOP trials). As context independence is essential for accurate estimation of SSRT in the race model, and as the choice stimulus presentation durations of the ABCD SST likely cause violations of the context independence assumption, especially at short stop-signal delays, SSRT estimates drawn from applications of the race model to these data could be inaccurate.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nThis issue does not affect the accurate recording of trial-level data, but it does present a problem for applications of SSRT measurement models, such as at the Independent Race Model, that assume context independence. However, the extent to which this design feature impacts estimates of SSRT, and whether this impact has a substantial effect on the rank ordering of subjects (i.e., whether individuals with high vs. low inhibitory ability still show relatively high and low SSRT estimates, respectively, even if the absolute values of SSRT are biased), has yet to be determined. Future experimental or computational modeling studies could help provide greater clarity about these questions. Current users are encouraged to carefully consider the assumptions of any measurement model they apply to these data and to consider the possible limitations of parameter estimates and measures derived from any model that assumes context independence. Another important implication related to this assumption is that individual participants who display mean RT on failed STOP trials that is longer than mean RT on GO trials (which occurs in a small subset of ABCD participants) exhibit a pattern of data that cannot be explained by a race model that assumes context independence. Therefore, users interested in applying models with this assumption should consider excluding these participants (who can be identified with the tfmri_sst_beh_violatorflag variable) as violators of the independence assumption.\n2. “Go” choice stimulus is not presented on STOP trials with a 0ms stop-signal delay.\nSummary:\nThis is a special case of the first issue discussed above. Since the visual stop-signal stimulus replaces the “go” choice stimulus after the stop-signal delay, the choice stimulus is not actually presented on trials where the stop-signal delay is 0ms. This may violate assumptions of measurement models applied to the task (including the Independent Race Model) and may confuse participants.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nSimilar to the first issue discussed above, the implications of this feature depend on the assumptions of the specific measurement model being applied to the data and whether users believe that this feature would substantially impact their ability to test their specific research question. Users may consider excluding these trials from analysis and/or excluding participants with a large proportion of these trials if they determine that doing so is appropriate. To facilitate these participant-level exclusions, variable tfmri_sst_beh_0ssdcount provides a count of how many 0ms stop-signal delay trials each participant has.\n3. A glitch leads to incorrect stop-signal delays for some participants.\nSummary:\nDue to a glitch in the experimental program, if a participant makes a response in &lt;50ms on a STOP trial where the stop-signal delay is equal to 50ms, all subsequent STOP trials will be erroneously recorded as having a response with the exact same RT on the “ssd” slide. Because these trials are incorrectly coded as stopping failures by the experimental program, all subsequent stop-signal delays will be stuck at 0ms. As the conditions that trigger this glitch are very specific, it is only present in about 3% of participants.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nAs this glitch leads incorrect values of sst_ssd_rt to be recorded on subsequent trials and leads to stop-signal delays that do not correspond to the task’s standard staircase pattern, users are encouraged to exclude participants who show evidence of the glitch (who can be identified with the tfmri_sst_beh_glitchflag variable). However, users should also note that, because the glitch primarily affects the sst_ssd_rt variable, but the pre-processing steps (outlined in Appendix B) ignore the “ssd” slide on trials with 0ms stop-signal delays, the constructed variables in the trial-level data (sst_primaryresp, sst_primaryrt, sst_choiceacc, sst_inhibitacc) should be accurate for subsequent trials.\n4. Stop-signal duration is shorter for trials with stop-signal delays &gt;700ms.\nSummary:\nIf the stop-signal delay for a given STOP trial is &gt;700ms, the stop-signal stimulus is not presented for the standard 300ms and is instead presented for a shorter duration (1000ms minus the stop-signal delay). As the Independent Race Model assumes “stop” context independence in addition to “go” context independence, and the shorter presentation time on these trials may violate this assumption, these trials may be inappropriate to include in race model analyses.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nAs these trials are relatively rare (roughly 1% of STOP trials in the data set), users may consider excluding them from analysis and/or excluding participants with a large proportion of these trials if they determine that doing so is appropriate.\n5. Non-uniform conditional trial probability.\nSummary:\nAs reviewed in detail in Bisset et al, the probability of encountering a stop signal on a given trial in the ABCD SST is not uniform and instead depends on the recency of previous STOP trials. The most notable feature of the conditional trial probability distribution is that STOP trials are never repeated two times in a row, which could allow participants to learn this contingency and therefore improve their performance on the task. However, the authors provide evidence that, at least for the baseline ABCD session, participants did not appear to learn the contingency.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nUnless users encounter compelling evidence that participants are learning the conditional trial probability contingencies, no adjustments are necessary.\n6. Trial accuracy incorrectly coded.\nSummary:\nThe experimental program incorrectly classified a small number (&lt;1%) of correct “go” choices as incorrect “go” choices and a small number (2-3%) of incorrect “go” choices as correct “go” choices. In addition, &lt;1% of stop failure trials were incorrectly classified as correctly inhibited STOP trials. These incorrect classifications were recorded in a column of the raw E-Prime output (“TrialCode”) that is not included in this trial-level data release and was not used to generate any of the constructed variables in the minimally pre-processed data columns.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nAs the column with these errors is not included in the data release, and as these errors would only have minimal impacts on participants’ stop-signal delays produced by the tracking algorithm, no adjustments are necessary.\n7. Stop-signal delay values start at 50ms.\nSummary:\nThe initial stop-signal delay value of 50ms, which is relatively low, could present problems if it leads to abnormally high stop success rates on the first few trials of the task or if it drives participants to shift their strategy over the course of the experiment. The authors provide evidence that stopping accuracy is elevated on the first 10 trials relative to the rest of the trials, and specifically that the first 7 trials have stop success rates &gt; .60.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nUsers can consider removing the first 7 to 10 STOP trials of the task or conducting separate sensitivity analyses in which these trials are removed.\n8. Low STOP trial probability.\nSummary:\nThe authors point out that the stop trial probability on the ABCD SST (.167) is somewhat lower than stop trial probabilities on most other SST paradigms (.25-.33). However, there are currently no indications that this low stop trial probability impacts inferences from the task.\nImplications for the use of trial-level data:\nUnless users encounter compelling evidence that this design feature impacts inferences, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n\nAppendix B\nDetails of minimal pre-processing steps\nThese pre-processing steps were conducted to facilitate the use of the trial-level data in most applications by creating variables that record participants’ first response on each trial (regardless of which slide this response occurs on), the global onset times of each trial, easily interpretable names for the stimuli and responses, and variables that indicate separately whether participants made accurate decisions on the choice task and whether they succeeded in inhibiting responses on STOP trials. The code used to implement the following pre-processing steps have been made publicly available on the ABCD-STUDY GitHub: https://github.com/ABCD-STUDY.\n1. Create general stimulus onset variable for all trials\n\nFor GO trials –&gt; set sst_stimonset = sst_go_onsettime\nFor STOP trials in which sst_ssd_dur &gt; 0ms –&gt; set sst_stimonset = sst_ssd_onsettime\nFor STOP trials in which sst_ssd_dur = 0ms –&gt; set sst_stimonset = sst_stopsignal_onsettime\n\n2. Create variable with details of the presented stimulus\n\nFor any trial in which sst_stimfile = “images/Right_Arrow.bmp” –&gt; set sst_stim = \"right_arrow\"\nFor any trial in which sst_stimfile = “images/Left_Arrow.bmp” –&gt; set sst_stim = \"left_arrow\"\n\n3. Determine response mapping for the participant\n\nResponses on the E-Prime slides (sst_go_resp, sst_fix_resp, sst_ssd_resp, sst_stopsignal_resp) are sometimes recorded as integers (e.g., 1 or 2) and sometimes recorded as strings (e.g., “LEFTARROW”). Therefore, the mapping between raw response data and the “right_arrow” and “left_arrow” responses must be established for each participant. If raw responses were integers, the sst_leftarrow and sst_rightarrow columns were used to establish response mapping. If raw responses were strings, the presence of “right” or “left” in the string was used to establish response mapping.\n\n4. Compute primary response and primary RT for GO trials\n\nIf the participant’s first response on the trial is during the “go” slide, the RT and response from that slide (sst_go_rt and sst_go_resp) are recorded as the participant’s primary RT and response for that trial. Subsequent responses during the following “fix” slide are ignored.\nIf the participant’s first response on the trial is instead during the “fix” slide (i.e., their response latency was &gt;1000ms), the reconstructed RT (sst_fix_rt + 1000) and the response (sst_fix_resp) from the “fix” slide are recorded as the participant’s primary RT and response for that trial.\nIf the participant fails to respond during either the “go” or “fix” slide, their response and RT on that trial are treated as missing (blank)\n\n5. Compute primary response and primary RT for STOP trials\n\nIf sst_ssd_dur &gt; 0ms AND sst_ssd_dur &gt; &lt;700ms:\n\nIf the participant’s first response on the trial is during the “ssd” slide, the RT and response from that slide (sst_ssd_rt and sst_ssd_resp) are recorded as the participant’s primary RT and response for that trial. Subsequent responses during the following “stopsignal” and “fix” slides are ignored.\nIf the participant’s first response on the trial is during the “stopsignal” slide, the reconstructed RT (sst_stopsignal_rttime - sst_ssd_onsettime) and the response (sst_stopsignal_resp) from that slide are recorded as the participant’s primary RT and response for that trial. Subsequent responses during the following “fix” slide are ignored.\nIf the participant’s first response on the trial is during the “fix” slide, the reconstructed RT (sst_fix_rt + 300 + sst_ssd_dur) and the response (sst_fix_resp) from that slide are recorded as the participant’s primary RT and response for that trial.\nIf the participant fails to respond during any of these three slides, their primary response and RT on that trial are treated as missing (blank)\n\nIf sst_ssd_dur = 0ms:\n\nIf the participant’s first response on the trial is during the “stopsignal” slide, the RT (sst_stopsignal_rt) and the response (sst_stopsignal_resp) from that slide are recorded as the participant’s primary RT and response for that trial. Subsequent responses during the following “fix” slide are ignored.\nIf the participant’s first response on the trial is during the “fix” slide, the reconstructed RT (sst_fix_rt + 300) and the response (sst_fix_resp) from that slide are recorded as the participant’s primary RT and response for that trial.\nIf the participant fails to respond during either of the two slides, their response and RT on that trial are treated as missing (blank)\n\nIf sst_ssd_dur &gt; 700ms:\n\nSame procedures as used above (for if sst_ssd_dur is &gt;0ms and &lt;700ms) are implemented, unless the first response is on the “fix” slide, in which case the RT is calculated simply as sst_fix_rt + 1000\n\n\n6. Compute accuracy variables\n\nTo compute the sst_choiceacc variable for each trial:\n\nIf sst_primaryresp = NA/blank –&gt; set sst_choiceacc = NA/blank\nIf sst_primaryresp ≠ NA/blank AND sst_stim = sst_primaryresp –&gt; set sst_choiceacc = 1\nIf sst_primaryresp ≠ NA/blank AND sst_stim ≠ sst_primaryresp –&gt; set sst_choiceacc = 0\n\nTo compute the sst_inhibitacc variable for each trial:\n\nIf sst_expcon = GoTrial, sst_inhibitacc = NA/blank\nIf sst_expcon ≠ GoTrial AND sst_primaryresp = NA/blank –&gt; set sst_inhibitacc = 1\nIf sst_expcon ≠ GoTrial AND sst_primaryresp ≠ NA/blank –&gt; set sst_inhibitacc = 0",

This is used to indicate items that are dependent on previous questions through branching logic or to indicate another direct relationship between two questions (e.g. ab_p_demo__empl__prtnr_001, “Does your partner work?”, has the follow up question ab_p_demo__empl__prtnr_001__01, “Full or part-time?”; 001__01 is only presented if 001 is endorsed).

Generally, questions with the same label are collapsed under one variable, even if they were collected under different variable names. The version indicator is only used in cases where a question has been replaced with a question that is very similar but has a somewhat distinct quality which necessitates to differentiate it from the original question (e.g., another version of the education variable was added to include additional response options after baseline).\ndm_s_tab_item__subitem__v1\nSubitem version: Indicator for a new, substantially different, version of a subitem question/variable.\ndm_s_tab_item__l\nLongitudinal marker: Indicator used for questions that are an exact replica of a question but have been slightly altered to account for the fact that the the question is being asked at a follow-up visit. Typically, this indicator is used in cases where the first time a question was asked, it referred to the lifetime up to that point, e.g., “Have you ever done X?”, while the version of the question asked at later visits refers to the time since the last time the question was asked, e.g., “Since we last saw you, have you done X?”.\ndm_s_tab_item__tag\nTags: Tags are additional keywords appended to variable names to provide additional context or categorization.

(check all that apply)”, variable names might include ___1 for “cats”, ___2 for “dogs”, and ___3 for “fish”. If a participant selects multiple options, each corresponding variable (e.g., dm_s_tab_item___1, dm_s_tab_item___3) will be marked to indicate the selected responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem keyword glossary\n\n\n\n\n\nA filterable keyword glossary for the ‘item’ component of all variables",

    "text": "ABCD’s curation standards are designed to ensure that the tabulated data resource is well-organized, consistent, and user-friendly. These standards encompass a variable naming convention, table- and variable-level standards, as well as general improvements to the accompanying metadata that enhance the usability and accessibility of the data. This page highlights the key elements of ABCD’s curation standards to facilitate effective use of the data and the data dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are curation standards important?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell-developed and systematically maintained “curation standards” are essential for organizing published datasets and making them more accessible to the user community. Large multi-modal longitudinal studies, such as the ABCD Study®, often face challenges in managing and organizing data over time, a phenomenon known as “data curation debt,” which refers to the accumulation of deficiencies in data management (Butters, Wilson, and Burton 2020).\nTo proactively address these issues, the ABCD consortium undertook a comprehensive recuration effort before the 6.0 data release and developed curation standards that were applied consistently across the entire tabulated data resource. This initiative aimed to enhance transparency and functionality for users, while also supporting ABCD’s open science model.\n\n\n\nThe variable naming convention is the cornerstone of ABCD’s data curation standards. Variable names constructed using this convention provide structured information about the assessment domain, data source, and the measure a variable belongs to. The standard incorporates a keyword system that links variables to their respective summary scores, indicates branching logic and versioning, and connects concepts across domains. For more details on the variable naming convention, see here.\nThe ABCD data dictionary implements standards for variable and data types, units, variable labels, and the coding of non-responses/missingness. It also includes administrative information and hyperlinks to relevant domain-, table-, and variable-specific documentation, as well as responsible data use and data quality warnings. Additionally, the data dictionary provides historic variable and table names to relate the new names to previously used ones. For more details on ABCD’s metadata, see here.",

The package is accompanied by a documentation website that provides extensive details on how to use the package to compute any of the hundreds of summary scores across the different research domains.\nOne of the goals of the package is to support transparency and reproducibility of ABCD release data by making available the exact algorithms and code that were used to compute the released summary scores, with the ability to tie a given data release version to a specific version of the codebase. The versioning also allows users to fix errors in the codebase and/or add new code to compute additional scores independent of the release timelines, i.e., updated versions of the package can be released at any time to fix errors and/or compute new scores based on the raw/item-level data.\nFurthermore, while clearly specifying how the official ABCD summary scores were computed, all functions in the package allow users some level of flexibility to change the computation and retrieve alternative scores. For example, while most functions specify a certain level of missingness that is allowed to still compute a given summary score (typically &gt;=80% completion is required), users can change a function parameter to apply a stricter or more lenient criterion. For some types of scores, the package even provides a set of basic functions that can be used flexibly to compute a variety of different scores (see, e.g., the functions to compute Timeline Followback summary scores).",

By making use of the study’s metadata, the functions automatically retrieve the needed columns from different files on disk, and join them to a data frame in memory. This provides a fast, storage- and memory-efficient, and highly reproducible way to work with NBDC data that can be used as an alternative to creating and downloading different datasets (and creating on-disk representations for each of them) through the DEAP or Lasso platforms (see here).\nFurthermore, the package provides several additional functions that assist users with the creation of analysis-ready datasets from NBDC studies. This includes a) different transformation functions, e.g., to convert categorical columns to (ordered or unordered) factors based on the information in the data dictionary and levels table or to assign variable and value labels to a dataset; b) filter/subsetting functions, e.g., to filter by a set of participant/events, filter ABCD events with shorthands, or exclude rows or columns with only missing data; as well as c) a set of utility functions with different use cases. Lastly, the NBDCtools package provides functions to retrieve and use the studies’ metadata.",

These formats do not support selective column loading and cannot embed metadata, such as data type specifications. As a result, programming languages like Python or R must guess the data types during import, which can lead to errors. For example, categorical values provided as numbers that are formatted as strings (e.g., \"0\"/\"1\" to represent “Yes”/“No”; see data type standards for more details) may be interpreted as numeric, and columns with mostly missing values may be treated as empty if the first few rows lack data. To avoid these issues, users need to manually specify column types using the accompanying metadata upon import. The NBDCtools R package offers a helper function, read_dsv_formatted(), to automate this process (see the R packages page for details).\nApache Parquet is a modern, compressed, columnar format optimized for large datasets and commonly used in the data science community. In contrast to plain-text files, Parquet supports selective column loading and results in smaller file sizes. This improves loading speed and memory usage, enhancing performance for analytical workflows. Crucially, parquet files can embed metadata (including column types, variable/value labels, and categorical coding), allowing for reliable and reproducible import of data without any manual steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBoth csv/tsv and parquet formats are provided to support a range of tools and user preferences.

As a result, Siemens scanners have two sets of DICOMs for each sMRI data series (i.e. T1, T2, T1_NORM, and T2_NORM). The non-normalized images with large intensity ranges (e.g. with a 64 channel head coil) may be clipped at 4095, impairing cortical reconstruction. The ABCD pipeline uses only the normalized sMRI (T1_NORM and T2_NORM), but both versions are included in the source data DICOMs and raw data NIfTI files.\n\n\ndMRI gradient tables for dMRI DICOMs\nRaw diffusion gradient tables (b values and vectors) per scanner manufacturer can be downloaded here:\n ABCD_Diffusion_Tables \nThese gradient tables are provided for convenience and reference. Diffusion directions are also included as bvecs/bvals files in the source and raw data BIDS structures.\nAdditional notes related to diffusion gradient tables:\n\nPrior to software version DV29, GE scanners did not encode the correct multishell gradient table into the DICOM header; a generic single-shell gradient table was encoded instead.\nThese gradient tables are only for use with unprocessed dMRI data. For minimally processed data, new vector tables are generated following motion correction and provided with the minimally processed data.\nFor GE, there are two different versions of the bvecs/bvals files, labeled “DV25” and “DV26”. The “DV25” version is specific to scans acquired with SoftwareVersion DV25. For all other software versions (DV26, DV28, DV29), the “DV26” files will work.\nFor GE, prior to DV29, the diffusion values are not correct in the DICOM header and need to come from an external file (such as a bvec/bval file). As of DV29, the correct diffusion directions can be found in the DICOM header, so no external bvec/bval file is needed if you have the dcm files.\nFor Siemens and Philips, the correct diffusion values can be found in the DICOM header.\n\n\n\nSiemens slice timing error\nSome Siemens fMRI data have been reported to have negative values for the Siemens CSA slice timing parameter which can prevent the conversion of DICOMs files in some software. This issue has been overcome in some software (e.g. current version of dcm2niix available for download at https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix).\n\n\nRaw data NIfTI file sharing\nUnprocessed imaging data are also made publicly available in NIfTI format in a “raw data” BIDS directory structure.

For task-fMRI series, also included are BIDS-compliant events.tsv files containing stimulus and behavioral response timing information extracted from the source data event timing files (i.e., exported from E-prime).

We provide BIDS formatted anatomical MRI images (T1w and T2w), functional MRI images with spin-echo field maps, and diffusion-weighted images with field maps, organized within the following folder structure. The BIDS directory includes separate folders for each modality:\n|__ abcc/\n    |__ rawdata/ \n        |__ participants.tsv\n        |__ participants.json \n        |__ sessions.json \n        |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;/\n            |__ sessions.tsv/\n            |__ ses-&lt;label&gt;/\n                |__ anat/\n                |__ dwi/\n                |__ fmap/\n                |__ func/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABCC and DAIRC BIDS Raw Data To Be Merged in Future Release\n\n\n\nNote that the BIDS raw data available under dairc/ and abcc/ will be merged into one collection for ABCD release 7.0 and ABCC-BIDS community collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession-level information is included in the sessions.tsv files located within the subject folders and includes session ID, acquisition time, age, site, scanner details, and automated QC metrics (see details here).\n\n\n\nThe participants.tsv file includes participant ID, sex, and a column for demographically matched subsets, matched_group, described in the following section. It also includes extra fields like ethnicity-related information and twin sibling status, which can be ignored as this data is easily accessible via Lasso Portal Query Tool or DEAP’s data dictionary & ontology browser. These extra fields will be removed in the next release.\n\n\nThe matched_group field of the participants.tsv file signifies each participant’s assignment to one of the ABCD Reproducible Matched Samples (ARMS). In Release 2.0, ABCD data were split into 3 demographically matched groups: ARMS-1 (N=5,786) and ARMS-2 (N= 5,786) for use as independent datasets, and ARMS-3 (N=305) for template building and model testing. These group assignments have been carried over into the current release, with the following updated counts: ARMS-1 (N=5,752), ARMS-2 (N=5,745), and ARMS-3 (N=301).\n\n\n\nMatched groups\n\n\nTo create the matched ARMS, we chose 9 salient sociodemographic factors thought to be important for developmental outcomes (site, age, sex, ethnicity, grade, highest level of parental education, handedness, combined family income, and exposure to anesthesia), and accounted for family structure (Marek et al. 2019). Anesthesia exposure was included as a matching variable to account for differences in major medical interventions and the possible effects on behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes (Schneuer et al. 2018). To maximize the relative independence of the two datasets, family members were kept together in the same ARM and the groups were matched to have equivalent numbers of sibling and twin pairs, and triplets.\nComparison of the counts and means for each of these factors shows that ARMS-1 and ARMS-2 are negligibly and not statistically different samples. Gender shows the largest absolute difference of 2.5%. No other demographic variables differ by more than 1%. See the ABCC paper - Feczko et al. (2021) - for a full description of how these matched groups were generated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomical files include T1- and T2-weighted MRI images organized under the anat/ folder of each subject and session. In the event that normalized files were not present, files that had not undergone normalization (e.g. sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_T1w.nii.gz) were used instead.\n...\n|__ anat/\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T1w.nii.gz \n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T1w.json\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T2w.nii.gz\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T2w.json\n\n\nImages in this dataset were acquired from three brands of MRI scanner: Siemens, Philips, and General Electric (GE). Siemens anatomical images have intensity normalization applied at the scanner and are therefore higher contrast compared to Philips and GE. This motivated inclusion of Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) de-noising as well as ANTs N4 bias field correction during the PreFreeSurfer stage of the processing pipeline for all data. We also implemented ANTs-based atlas registration in PostFreeSurfer instead of FSL’s FNIRT-based method. While these changes had little effect on the high-quality anatomical Siemens data, they significantly improved results for both Philips and GE scanner data.\n\n\n\n\nFunctional files include BOLD functional runs acquired for each task under the func/ folder (including task- MID, nback, SST, and rest, as available) as well as corresponding EPI fieldmaps acquired in AP (dir-AP) and PA (dir-PA) phase encoding directions under fmap/. The functional fieldmaps can be distinguished from DWI fieldmaps via the acq-func tag in the filenames.\n...\n|__ func/\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_task-&lt;MID|nback|SST|rest&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_bold.nii.gz\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_task-&lt;MID|nback|SST|rest&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_bold.json\n|\n|__ fmap/\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_acq-func_dir-&lt;AP/PA&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_epi.nii.gz\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_acq-func_dir-&lt;AP/PA&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_epi.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent-Related Information (ERI) Files\n\n\n\nNote that the ERI files for tasks (MID, nback, SST), if present, are provided under dairc/sourcedata/.\n\n\n\n\nA single pair of positive (posterior to anterior) and negative (anterior to posterior) spin echo field maps are acquired along with each functional scan. Fieldmaps are utilized during image preprocesing to correct for distortions in the phase encoding direction of each fMRI volume using FSL’s topup (see for ABCD-BIDS Pipeline for details). These field maps are highly susceptible to motion artifacts and can have a negative effect on processing if they are not high-quality. Because field maps are largely consistent between runs, we decided to select only a single pair of spin echo field maps to use for all anatomical and functional scans for distortion correction. Based on the assumption that field maps with large motion artifacts will have more noise and higher variance from the average, the abcd-dcm2bids wrapper selects the optimal field map pair based on those with the least variance from the registered group average.

    "text": "The ABCC data made available in the data release utilizes the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard for data organization. We provide BIDS formatted anatomical MRI images (T1w and T2w), functional MRI images with spin-echo field maps, and diffusion-weighted images with field maps, organized within the following folder structure. The BIDS directory includes separate folders for each modality:\n|__ abcc/\n    |__ rawdata/ \n        |__ participants.tsv\n        |__ participants.json \n        |__ sessions.json \n        |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;/\n            |__ sessions.tsv/\n            |__ ses-&lt;label&gt;/\n                |__ anat/\n                |__ dwi/\n                |__ fmap/\n                |__ func/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABCC and DAIRC BIDS Raw Data To Be Merged in Future Release\n\n\n\nNote that the BIDS raw data available under dairc/ and abcc/ will be merged into one collection for ABCD release 7.0 and ABCC-BIDS community collection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession-level information is included in the sessions.tsv files located within the subject folders and includes session ID, acquisition time, age, site, scanner details, and automated QC metrics (see details here).\n\n\n\nThe participants.tsv file includes participant ID, sex, and a column for demographically matched subsets, matched_group, described in the following section. It also includes extra fields like ethnicity-related information and twin sibling status, which can be ignored as this data is easily accessible via Lasso Portal Query Tool or DEAP’s data dictionary & ontology browser. These extra fields will be removed in the next release.\n\n\nThe matched_group field of the participants.tsv file signifies each participant’s assignment to one of the ABCD Reproducible Matched Samples (ARMS). In Release 2.0, ABCD data were split into 3 demographically matched groups: ARMS-1 (N=5,786) and ARMS-2 (N= 5,786) for use as independent datasets, and ARMS-3 (N=305) for template building and model testing. These group assignments have been carried over into the current release, with the following updated counts: ARMS-1 (N=5,752), ARMS-2 (N=5,745), and ARMS-3 (N=301).\n\n\n\nMatched groups\n\n\nTo create the matched ARMS, we chose 9 salient sociodemographic factors thought to be important for developmental outcomes (site, age, sex, ethnicity, grade, highest level of parental education, handedness, combined family income, and exposure to anesthesia), and accounted for family structure (Marek et al. 2019). Anesthesia exposure was included as a matching variable to account for differences in major medical interventions and the possible effects on behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes (Schneuer et al. 2018). To maximize the relative independence of the two datasets, family members were kept together in the same ARM and the groups were matched to have equivalent numbers of sibling and twin pairs, and triplets.\nComparison of the counts and means for each of these factors shows that ARMS-1 and ARMS-2 are negligibly and not statistically different samples. Gender shows the largest absolute difference of 2.5%. No other demographic variables differ by more than 1%. See the ABCC paper - Feczko et al. (2021) - for a full description of how these matched groups were generated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnatomical files include T1- and T2-weighted MRI images organized under the anat/ folder of each subject and session. In the event that normalized files were not present, files that had not undergone normalization (e.g. sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_T1w.nii.gz) were used instead.\n...\n|__ anat/\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T1w.nii.gz \n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T1w.json\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T2w.nii.gz\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_(rec-normalized_)T2w.json\n\n\nImages in this dataset were acquired from three brands of MRI scanner: Siemens, Philips, and General Electric (GE). Siemens anatomical images have intensity normalization applied at the scanner and are therefore higher contrast compared to Philips and GE. This motivated inclusion of Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) de-noising as well as ANTs N4 bias field correction during the PreFreeSurfer stage of the processing pipeline for all data. We also implemented ANTs-based atlas registration in PostFreeSurfer instead of FSL’s FNIRT-based method. While these changes had little effect on the high-quality anatomical Siemens data, they significantly improved results for both Philips and GE scanner data.\n\n\n\n\nFunctional files include BOLD functional runs acquired for each task under the func/ folder (including task- MID, nback, SST, and rest, as available) as well as corresponding EPI fieldmaps acquired in AP (dir-AP) and PA (dir-PA) phase encoding directions under fmap/. The functional fieldmaps can be distinguished from DWI fieldmaps via the acq-func tag in the filenames.\n...\n|__ func/\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_task-&lt;MID|nback|SST|rest&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_bold.nii.gz\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_task-&lt;MID|nback|SST|rest&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_bold.json\n|\n|__ fmap/\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_acq-func_dir-&lt;AP/PA&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_epi.nii.gz\n|   |__ sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_acq-func_dir-&lt;AP/PA&gt;_run-&lt;label&gt;_epi.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent-Related Information (ERI) Files\n\n\n\nNote that the ERI files for tasks (MID, nback, SST), if present, are provided under dairc/sourcedata/.\n\n\n\n\nA single pair of positive (posterior to anterior) and negative (anterior to posterior) spin echo field maps are acquired along with each functional scan. Fieldmaps are utilized during image preprocesing to correct for distortions in the phase encoding direction of each fMRI volume using FSL’s topup (see for ABCD-BIDS Pipeline for details). These field maps are highly susceptible to motion artifacts and can have a negative effect on processing if they are not high-quality. Because field maps are largely consistent between runs, we decided to select only a single pair of spin echo field maps to use for all anatomical and functional scans for distortion correction. Based on the assumption that field maps with large motion artifacts will have more noise and higher variance from the average, the abcd-dcm2bids wrapper selects the optimal field map pair based on those with the least variance from the registered group average. The chosen pair of field maps list all anatomical and functional runs in the IntendedFor field of their sidecar JSONs.\n\n\n\n\nDiffusion files include DWI (*_dwi.nii.gz) as well as associated bval and bvec files with information about the strength of the diffusion gradient applied during each volume and diffusion gradients directions, respectively.

    "section": "BIDS Conversion Procedures",
    "text": "BIDS Conversion Procedures\nPrior to processing, raw DICOM data files are converted to BIDS NIfTIs, provided in the data release (dairc/sourcedata/), using the abcd-dicom2bids wrapper for baseline and year 2 sessions and the abcc_dicom2bids_s3 wrapper for years 4 and 6.\n\nQuality Control Filter\nThis wrapper first uses the ABCD FastTrack control file to select scans for inclusion based on whether they had a passing QC score (usable == 1). This file is periodically updated to reflect corrections in scan usability scores. The Fasttrack QC file provided in the release (dairc/sourcedata/fasttrack_mri_qc.csv) was used for conversion of Years 4 and 6, while Baseline and Year 2 sessions were filtered based on an older version (abcd_fastqc01.txt from May 2023). We have converted this file to Parquet format and stripped non-essential columns to reduce the file size: abcd_fastqc01_stripped.parquet. It can be downloaded by DUC-approved users via the ABCD Private Release Notes (this page can also be reached via the Lasso Portal Help Center).\nIn the current version of the FastTrack file, a consolidated column named usable has been introduced. This column replaces three separate columns from earlier versions: ftq_quality, ftq_complete, and abcd_compliant. The usable column is assigned a value of 1 if all three of the original columns (ftq_quality, ftq_complete, and abcd_compliant) have values not equal to 0. If any of these columns has a value of 0, then usable is set to 0.\nQC for Years 4 and 6 relied on this usable column, where files were excluded from BIDS conversion and processing if usable == 0. For Baseline and Year 2 sessions, filtering was based on a previous version of the FastTrack file, using the original ftq_quality and ftq_complete columns. In these cases, files were downloaded and converted to BIDS only if both ftq_quality and ftq_complete had values not equal to 0.\n\n\nData Completeness Filters\nAfter the file list was filtered to remove all files that did not pass QC, the following additional filters were applied to generate the final list of files selected for BIDS conversion and subsequent processing:\n\nAnatomical Data\nSessions were required to have a usable T1w file at minimum in order to convert to BIDS and process and are otherwise excluded from the release data. When both usable baseline and normalized anatomicals were present, only the normalized T1w/T2w was converted. In the event that normalized files were not present, files that had not undergone normalization (e.g. sub-&lt;label&gt;_ses-&lt;label&gt;_T1w.nii.gz) were used instead.\n\n\nFunctional Data\nFunctional runs were only converted if a set of usable AP and PA fieldmaps were present. Sessions without usable fieldmaps do not include a func/ folder in the BIDS inputs or functional fieldmaps under fmaps/. These sessions were processed through only the structural portion of the pipeline.\n\n\n\nBIDS Conversion & Validation\nAfter download, DICOMs are converted to BIDS NIfTIs using Christophe Bedetti’s Dcm2Bids wrapper for the Chris Rorden Lab dcm2niix. The wrapper also performs BIDS validation using the official BIDS validator. For years 4 and 6, an additional file-wise audit tool was used to ensure all the required files were present. This included checking for required functional runs, anatomical scans (including checking that non-normalized scans are only present if normalized scans are not available), diffusion files, and ensuring that fieldmap pairs were included for each subject/session. After BIDS conversion was complete, all data were run through cuBIDS (v1.2.0) to perform a final round of BIDS validation and resolve all errors noted in the outputs.\n\n\nDiffusion Values for bval/bvec\nDuring BIDS conversion, the bval and bvec file values associated with the DWI data are typically extracted directly from the DICOMs, as was the case for conversion of data from Siemens and Philips scanner vendors. For GE, these values were provided by the DAIRC and can be found in the nda-abcd-s3-downloader repository.",

Starting with Release 3.0.0 (2025-06-26), the ABCC is made available through the NBDC Data Hub and does not reflect revisions made to the NDA repository. The release history for versions 2.0.0 and below are provided below for legacy purposes. Please visit the ABCC Archival Data Release Documentation for the archived release documentation associated wih the data available for prior releases via the NDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease 2.0.0 (2022-06-22)\n\n\n\n\n\nREVISIONS\n\nUploading 144 participants with new data due to revised fast track QC: The initial release was processed prior to new updates to the fast track QC spreadsheet that affected the original inputs for 144 participants. This led to discrepancies in the number of timepoints reported for connectivity matrices (see below) relative to the inputs. The 144 participants were re-processed through the ABCD-BIDS pipeline at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI). The participants.tsv file indicates which subjects were reprocessed. These subjects have new Gordon 10 and 5 minute connectivity matrices generated and replaced on the NDA. The old matrices remain valid, but may use different frames from the new matrices. The labels for the updated connectivity matrices were defined in Gordon et al. (2016) and generated using the DCAN Labs cifti connectivity wrapper at a frame displacement (FD) threshold of 0.2 mm to filter out high-motion frames. An outlier detection procedure was used to exclude remaining frames 2 STD from the mean.\nProviding Connectivity matrices for those participants with discrepancies in the number of timepoints used\nUploading JSONs for the diffusion inputs in some participants.\nUpdated version of the participants.tsv to v1.0.2 includes correction to site and sex designation for a small subset of subjects based on new information from the DAIRC.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS\n\nIndividualized Network Maps Generated with Infomap and Template Matching (Submission ID: 36448)\nDerivatives for the fmriprep pipeline: fMRIPrep v20.2.0 was run on all 10,038 participants whose visit one data was successfully converted to BIDS. The limited fMRIPrep processing errors were due to subjects that did not have any valid fMRI runs, but we did not do any manual quality control of outputs. 9,484 participants have at least one output.

    "section": "Protocol Compliance and Quality Control",
    "text": "Protocol Compliance and Quality Control\nAll ABCD MRI exams have been systematically checked for MRI protocol compliance and completeness, and images have been manually rated for quality by trained MR analysts before and after processing. All MRI data are provided, but we highly recommend that researchers filter subjects by QC results based on the project aims and tolerance for MR artifacts/motion. Severe artifact in all T1w image in a given visit (MRI Quality Control: iqc_t1_ok_ser = 0) results in the inability to produce subsequent MR-metrics for all other modalities.\n\nE-Prime errors in task fMRI\nFor task fMRI, series were also excluded due to E-Prime problems including missing, corrupted, duplicated or unsynchronized E-Prime files. The variety of E-Prime errors that would invalidate the series are generalized in the task-specific QC instruments as being “mismatched” (iqc_mid_ep_t_series_match = 1; iqc_nback_ep_t_series_match = 1; iqc_sst_ep_t_series_match = 1). In manual review, some errors can be corrected, so there is an additional override to this switch when needed (eprime_mismatch_ok_mid = 1; eprime_mismatch_ok_mid = 1, eprime_mismatch_ok_mid = 1).\n\n\nBehavioral performance in task fMRI\nBehavioral measures calculated from participant button presses during task fMRI acquisition are also included (see Behavioral Performance During Task-Based fMRI release note). Based on those measures, behavioral performance flags are provided, indicating whether a subject’s performance for each task was within acceptable standards. It is suggested that users exclude subjects from group analysis based on sub-optimal performance and possibly additional criteria such as the number of degrees of freedom (reduced by motion censoring) in the individual subject task-fMRI analysis and/or based on outlier detection on the ROI-averages themselves. Users should choose inclusion/exclusion performance criteria that are appropriate for their analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsible Use Warning: Head motion\n\n\n\n\n\nHead motion is a serious issue for neuroimaging, and especially for resting state fMRI. It creates brain-wide artifactual effects including elevated short-distance connectivity and attenuated long-distance connectivity (Power et al. 2012). In order to guard against artifactual effects due to head motion, researchers typically implement a variety of strategies that operate at multiple points of the data collection and processing pipeline, with guidance regularly evolving over time (Power et al. 2014; Power, Schlaggar, and Petersen 2015; Satterthwaite et al. 2013; Siegel et al. 2017; Gratton et al. 2020). Some of these strategies include discarding entire runs of data that exceed certain motion thresholds and discarding individual functional imaging frames that are proximal to motion events (i.e., “motion censoring”). These strategies in particular typically lead to the exclusion of some participants from further analysis for lack of sufficient data. Levels of head motion differ according to demographic factors such as sex, race/ethnicity, and SES (Cosgrove et al. 2022). Therefore, strategies to deal with head motion may lead to differential exclusions across demographic groups. In addition, data quality procedures cause sessions to vary by the amount of data remaining. Such variability may continue to inflate findings especially in the presence of conditions that may correlate with the motion artifact like autism or ADHD (Eggebrecht et al. 2017). One strategy that avoids this confound is to strictly control the degrees of freedom, where functional connectivity measures are calculated with the exact same amount of data. To aid researchers in exploring this impact further, the ABCD study has released 5 minute- and 10 minute-trimmed and untrimmed functional connectivity datasets. Researchers interested in examining brain-behavior associations or multivariate predictions should follow strategies such as those in Eggebrecht et al. (2017): 1) assess how missing data impacts dependent, independent variables and covariates, 2) examine the association between the degrees of freedom and non-FC variables, 3) use trimmed FC measures when needed to mitigate artifacts due to data quality.\nFor more information please see: “Resting-state fMRI Data Documentation”.",

Analyses comparing groups based solely on demographic categories may lead to misinterpretations about neurobiological differences and unintended implications regarding participants’ abilities or outcomes. To avoid potential misinterpretation or misuse of research findings, data users must carefully consider all variables included in their analyses, and ensure results are presented with appropriate scientific context.\nAny group comparisons should incorporate comprehensive, contextual factors beyond single demographic categories, such as environmental or behavioral variables, to enhance scientific rigor and interpretation accuracy. Researchers are encouraged to proactively mitigate the risk of results being misconstrued or used in ways that could negatively affect individuals or groups participating in or impacted by their research.\nMissingness issues\nParticipants in the ABCD Study may not have usable data for a variety of reasons. They may have withdrawn from the study, or they may have missed assessments or sessions. In other cases, data may have been collected but it is inappropriate for inclusion in an analysis. For example, neuroimaging data may be inappropriate for analysis due to excessive head motion (see the discussion of head motion in Resting-State MRI Data Documentation).\nFactors associated with missing or unusable data can correlate with participant characteristics or environmental variables. Researchers should carefully assess patterns of missing data to understand how these patterns may influence analytical outcomes and interpretations. Additionally, researchers are encouraged to implement appropriate statistical methods, such as imputation or population weighting (Gard et al. 2023), to reduce biases resulting from missing data, thus improving the representativeness and generalizability of their results.",

    "text": "Overview of selection strategies\nBecause there were no significant changes in the MRI processing pipeline between ABCD Release 4.0 and Release 6.0, it was not necessary to reprocess most of the previously collected imaging data, except in rare cases, such as due to recovery of missing data or revision of manual raw QC. Because of this, manual post-processing QC scores from Release 4.0 were mostly carried forward into Release 6.0. Changes to the processing were made between Release 3.0 and 4.0, so the old QC scores were not carried forward for Release 4.0. Instead, participant-events were selected for manual post-processig QC based on failed post-processing QC from Release 3.0, random selection of participant-events, and statistical outliers (see below for details). The manual scoring and automated QC metrics for those three sets were then used for classifier guided selection (see below for details), and those additional visits were reviewed as well. For more recently collected imaging data not included in Release 4.0, additional subsets of participant-events were selected for manual post-processing QC using classifier guided selection and Mahalanobis distance outliers (see below for details). In addition, we undertook a limited retrospective review of past QC failures to help ensure that usable data were not inappropriately or mistakenly marked for exclusion (see below for details).",

    "text": "Selection strategies used for Release 4.0\n\nFailed post-processing QC from Release 3.0\nAll participant-events that failed QC for a given modality in Release 3.0 were manually reviewed again after Release 4.0 processing, with the expectation that they would be likely candidates for failure, unless perhaps recovered due to improvements in the Release 4.0 processing pipeline. These made up about 25-50% of manually reviewed participant-events for Release 4.0.\n\n\nRandom selection\nRoughly 5% of the manually reviewed participant-events for Release 4.0 were chosen at random to avoid possible biases and insensitivities of the automated measures that guided the initial sub-sampling selection process.\n\n\nStatistical outliers\nROI summary vectors for all individual participant-events were used to deduce a statistical ensemble profile. Participant-events with the greatest “distance” to the ensemble were tagged as outliers and selected for manual review. The formal framework we used for defining the ensemble statistics and the “distance” measure between a scan and the ensemble is based on the Mahalanobis distance (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance). Mahalanobis distance is a scalar measure of the distance between a point P, defined in a multi-dimensional vector space, and a distribution D. In our case, participant-events were sorted based on their Mahalanobis distances, and our manual review goal targeted the top 5% of that list. These made up ~20-25% of manually reviewed participant-events.\n\n\nClassifier-guided selection\nUsing the manual scoring of the above sets, namely the random samples, Release 3.0 QC failures, and Mahalanobis distance outliers, we collected a subset of manually labeled scan data. For each participant-event we generated a set of automated measures described in Automated Post Processing QC. Using binarized (pass/fail) manual quality control (QC) labels associated with these measures, we constructed a Bayesian classifier (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_classifier) that calculates the probability of QC failure associated with different types of QC issues (e.g., bad registration or brain FOV cutoff) for any given dataset. Each combination of automated QC metric and manual quality (QU) score was tested. Combinations of manual QC scores and automated QC metrics with low correlation (r &lt; 0.5) or low classification accuracy (ROC AUC &lt; 0.6) were excluded for use in selection. Selected manual QU scores were binarized such that “QC fail” was defined as QU score &gt; 2, and “QC pass” was defined as QU score &lt;= 2. Relative QC failure probabilities given a particular automated QC metric value were calculated for each combination of manual scores and automated metics. Participant-events were sorted based on their QC failure probabilities, and roughly the top 3-5% were selected for manual review for each modality, making up ~30-50% of manually reviewed participant-events in Release 4.0.",

    "text": "Selection strategies used for Release 5.0 and 6.0\n\nMultivariate classifier-guided selection\nFor imaging data collected more recently than that included in Release 4.0, the classifier-guided selection approach described above was extended to use a multivariate logistic regression that uses multiple auto QC metrics as well as the Mahalanobis distance metrics derived from ROI summary measures. The Mahalanobis distance value was calculated separately for each modality represented in the tabulated ROI summary measures (i.e., FreeSurfer, T1w, T2w, dMRI-DTI, dMRI-RSI, MID, nBack, SST, rsfMRI). These outlier distance metrics were included along with the other automated QC metrics used for prediction.\nFor each manual post-processing QU score, automated metrics (including automated QC metrics and Mahalanobis distances) with low correlation (r &lt; 0.5) or low classification accuracy (ROC AUC &lt; 0.6) to the manual QU score were excluded for use in selection. The remaining set of automated metrics were transformed with singular value decomposition to remove redundant information. The resulting reduced matrix was entered into a logistic regression with the binarized QU score. The values predicted by the logistic regression were then passed to the Bayesian classifier described above to calculate the probability of QC failure. Additional methodological details and an analysis of selection performance will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Hagler et al., in preparation).\n\n\nRetrospective QC review\nA retrospective review of prior, post-processing QC failures was undertaken to ensure that usable data were not inappropriately or mistakenly marked for exclusion. This was done on a limited basis for particular causes of QC failure when we found reason to doubt some of the reviews of a given type; e.g., white matter underestimation, T1 or T2 intensity inhomogeneity. In this re-review, scores were changed in some but not most cases selected for re-review.Methods\nImage processing and analysis methods corresponding to ABCD Release 2.0.1 are described in Hagler et al.

Please see the ABCD-BIDS pipeline webpage for a full overview of this pipeline.\nABCC data was processed through the ABCD-BIDS pipeline in two different ways with the following command and parameters.\nFor the structural pipeline up to the post-Freesurfer stage:\nsingularity run --cleanenv \\\n  -B ${data_dir}/bids_dataset:/bids_dir \\\n  -B ${data_dir}/derivatives/abcd-hcp-pipeline_v0.1.4:/output_dir \\\n  -B ${run_dir}/license.txt:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt \\\n  -B ${run_dir}/ABCD_BIDS_cleaning.json:/ABCD_BIDS_cleaning.json \\\n  /ABCD-BIDS/abcd-hcp-pipeline_R2019a-test_07222024a.sif \\\n  /bids_dir /output_dir \\\n  --freesurfer-license /opt/freesurfer/license.txt \\\n  --participant-label ${subject_id} \\\n  --stages \"PreFreeSurfer:PostFreeSurfer\" \\\n  --custom-clean /ABCD_BIDS_cleaning.json \\\n  --ignore func \\\n  --ncpus 8\nFor the full pipeline (including all stages):\nenv -i ${singualrity} run \\\n  -B ${data_dir}/bids_dataset:/bids_dir \\\n  -B ${data_dir}/derivatives/abcd-hcp-pipeline_v0.1.4:/output_dir \\\n  -B ${run_dir}/license.txt:/opt/freesurfer/license.txt \\\n  -B ${run_dir}/ABCD_BIDS_cleaning.json:/ABCD_BIDS_cleaning.json \\\n  /ABCD-BIDS/abcd-hcp-pipeline_R2019a-test_07222024a.sif \\\n  /bids_dir /output_dir \\\n  --freesurfer-license /opt/freesurfer/license.txt \\\n  --participant-label ${subject_id} \\\n  --stages \"PreFreeSurfer:CustomClean\" \\\n  --bandstop 18.582 25.726 \\\n  --custom-clean /ABCD_BIDS_cleaning.json \\\n  --ncpus 8\n\nAdditional Details\nDistortion Correction\nA single optimal pair of positive (posterior to anterior) and negative (anterior to posterior) spin echo field maps are utilized to correct for distortions in the phase encoding direction of ALL anatomical and functional acquisitions using FSL’s topup (see section on BIDS Conversion for details on fmap pair selection)\nRespiratory Motion Filter\nIn working with ABCD data, we have found that a respiratory artifact is produced within multi-band data (Fair et al. 2020). While this artifact occurs outside the brain, it can affect estimates of frame alignment, leading to inappropriate motion censoring. By filtering the frequencies (18.582 to 25.726 breaths per minute) of the respiratory signal from the motion realignment data (during the DCANBoldProc stage), our respiratory motion filter produces better estimates of FD.\n\n\nResolved ABCD-BIDS Pipeline Processing Issues\nThe following issues occurred while processing the ABCD MRI data through the ABCD-BIDS pipeline. They have been resolved for the current release data, but are included here for additional guidance for those who may wish to process the data themselves:\n\nFieldmap Dimension Mismatch in TopupPreprocessingAll.sh (GE Only)\nDescription: The spin echo fieldmap has different dimensions than the scout image in a portion of GE sessions, causing a preprocessing error.\nSolution: Resize the fieldmaps (fmaps) using the bold file as the reference size.\nSteps to Resolve:\nRun the following command: flirt -in \"$fmap_file\" -ref \"$func_run\" -out \"$output_file\" -applyisoxfm 2.4\nIncorrect Fieldmap Assignment in FMRIVolume Step\nDescription: The wrong fieldmap is being assigned, leading to processing errors during the FMRIVolume step.\nSolution: Update the fieldmap JSON files to include the correct runs that were missed during previous steps.\nFNIRT Read Error - Insufficient Volumes\nDescription: FNIRT requires at least three volumes to process. This error occurs when functional data is incomplete or corrupted.\nSolution: Skip the functional pipeline and run only the anatomical pipeline for affected cases.\nIssue: Index Error in anat_only Cases\nDescription: In anat_only cases, fmap JSON files interfere with the pipeline, causing index errors.\nSolution: Sync only the anat folder for such cases temporarily.\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\nABCD-BIDS Pipeline\nAdvanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)\nFreeSurfer\nDCAN Labs resting state fMRI analysis tools\nBrainSprite\nDCAN-Labs/cifti-connectivity tools",

This consisted of rigid body, affine and nonlinear transformations. In total eleven multimodal channels were used to align scans and create the MINT ABCD atlas, however the input channels varied according to the registration step. Three structural MRI (sMRI) channels were included: T1w images, white matter segmentation, and grey matter segmentation; and eight diffusion MRI (dMRI) channels: the zeroth and second order spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients of the restricted orientation distribution function (ODF) and the zeroth order SH coefficients from the hindered and free water FODs from the restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) model. sMRI and dMRI channels were first aligned within-subject using rigid body registration transforms. Then inter-subject anatomical alignment was achieved using rigid body, affine and nonlinear transforms.\nAn iterative procedure was used to generate a registration target and the final ABCD atlas. The initial registration target was chosen as the atlas image used by Hagler et al. (2019) for the AtlasTrack method. A weighted group average was calculated for all eleven channels and the registration target was updated with the new multimodal average. The registration was repeated and the registration target updated again. This procedure was repeated three times, producing the iteratively refined multimodal ABCD atlas.\nAll available scans from all observations included in Data Release 6.0 were registered to the final group average, the ABCD atlas. The warps were applied to numerous imaging measures across dMRI, sMRI and tfMRI. This produced 3D volumes which were anatomically aligned across observations and modalities.",

AEA, 2-AG, 2-OG, OEA, and PEA were quantified in lipids extracted from 0.4 ml of serum using isotope-dilution, mass spectrometry following the methods outlined in Spagnolo et al. (2016). Briefly, solid phase extraction columns are used to separate lipids after the addition of deuterated standards (150 pg/µl AEA and 1800 pg/µl 2-AG). The LC-MS-MS analysis is conducted using an Agilent Technologies 6460 Triple Quad LC-MS with a Chromasil, 5 µ C18 column with dimensions of 250 x 2.00 mm. AEA, 2-AG, 2OG, OEA, and PEA amounts are determined using isotope dilution; standard curves are constructed from a set of 10 combos, each containing different AEA/2AG concentrations together with deuterated AEA and 2-AG at the same concentrations in the samples. The concentration ratios in the samples are calculated from area ratios using the slopes determined from the standard curves, and converted to concentrations using the amount of deuterated standard added and the original sample volume. Finalized AEA, 2-AG, PEA, OEA and 2-OG levels (pmol/mL) are provided and harmonized with the larger ABCD study dataset.\nReferences\n\nCedernaes et al. (2016)\nHanlon et al. (2015)\nHeyman et al.

At each wave, the youth and parents completed separate surveys.\nWe sent wave 1, 2, and 3 on May 16-22, 2020, June 24-27, 2020, and August 4-5, 2020, respectively. Wave 4, 5, and 6 were sent October 8, 2020, December 13, 2020, and March 2, 2021. Wave 7 was sent in May 2021.\nCOVID Fitbit participation: When site and school closures began in March 2020, ABCD participants who had their ABCD-assigned activity tracker agreed to extend protocol wear of the device, contributing valuable objective physical activity, resting heart rate, and sleep data (N=160). Tabular data from this subset of participants is available in the table covid_y_fitbqtn.\nFor additional information about the COVID Rapid Response Research (RRR) Survey, please see (Pelham et al. 2023).\n\n\nSome variables were carried over from the COVID RRR studies into the main protocol after the COVID surveys ended. There are a small handful of cases where the variables that were in the main protocol and were utilized in the COVID RRR surveys too.\nIn the following, the covid variables are matched to the core-protocol variables. Users can use this information on the continuity of those variables if they are interested in tracking past the RRR surveys.",

    "text": "COVID Rapid Response Research (RRR) Survey (Youth)\n covid_y_qtn\nInformation about the dates of survey completion in the COVID Substudy is recorded in covid_y_qtn_dt.\nDuring data collection, a timestamp was recorded only when the respondent completed the final question on the survey. Some participants completed part of the survey but did not reach the end. In this case, the participant’s record will include data for whatever parts of the survey they completed, but the corresponding variable indicating the date of survey completion will have a missing value.\nThe below sections do not delineate specific variable tables but rather thematically similar variables. They generally will have consistent keywords across sections but may not contain all the same keywords. To learn more about keywords see our documentation on variable naming conventions.\n\nPet ownership\nYouth were asked if they have a pet (covid_y_qtn__pet_001), and if so, what kind (covid_y_qtn__pet_001__…).\n\n\nSchooling\nYouth were first asked to respond whether their schooling was like it was before COVID-19 Pandemic: whether they went to school, got school-at-home, or a mix of both. If youth responded that they had any school activities, they were asked to respond to four questions about the average time per day spent on different kinds of school material.\nTwo further survey items were administered only at youth survey wave 07. Each item asked about the number of days in the past week the youth attended school in-person (covid_y_qtn__school_002__01__v1) or from home (covid_y_qtn__school_002__02__v1).\nYouth were asked how many days per week they were helped or supervised by a parent or guardian for schoolwork. If they responded one day or more, they were asked to specify how many days per week they were assisted by an adult for various activities.\nThree questions were constructed to ask how they find their schoolwork, whether they are worried about missing school, and whether they are enjoying school.\nNotes and special considerations: Some outlying responses were observed for a very small number (&lt;0.1%) of participants for the following items:\n\ncovid_y_qtn__school_004\ncovid_y_qtn__school_005\ncovid_y_qtn__school_006\ncovid_y_qtn__school_007\n\nSome children reported taking online classes for more than 24 hours a day, if one combines all mutually exclusive responses, which is not possible and may be due to confusion by respondent between “how many hours a day” and “how many hours a week”. Please note that we corrected these items in the next version of the questionnaire to avoid this problem for wave 4 onward. There are some longitudinal discrepancies between wave 1 and wave 2 / wave 3 due to the summer period; for instance the correlation between wave 1 and wave 2 is moderate for the following items (covid_y_qtn__school_004; covid_y_qtn__school_005; covid_y_qtn__school_006), due to substantial changes in school activities due to the summer period. Correlation between wave 2 and wave 3 is high, suggesting that the pattern was consistent within the summer period.\n\n\nRoutines\nDaily routines: Six questions ask about daily routines with options on a 5-point Likert scale, from ‘never’ to ‘very frequently’. Some items are derived from The Questionnaire of Unpredictability in Childhood (Glynn et al. (2019)), and ask about typical morning and bedtime routines, participation in family activities, and worrying about family not having enough money to pay for necessities.\nSleep: Questions about typical sleep behavior in the past week were derived from the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, and Merrow (2003)). Variables included are:\n\nTime of going to bed ( hours; night-time hours only)\nTime of actually starting to fall asleep (hours; night-time hour options only)\nMinutes needed to fall asleep\nNumber of awakenings during the night (up to 10)\nTotal time awake during the night\nTime of waking up (hours; daytime hour options only)\nTime of starting schoolwork (hours; daytime hour options only)\n\nPhysical activity: Questions about physical activity in the past week (no distinction is made for school days and school-free days) are modified from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form (Lee et al. (2011)). Questions ask about walking and moderate/vigorous activity, first establishing the number of days that these activities were performed, followed by the amount of time spent doing the activity on a day. A question is included about daily sedentary (sitting) activity.\nReferences:\n\nGlynn et al. (2019)\nRoenneberg, Wirz-Justice, and Merrow (2003)\nLee et al. (2011)\n\n\n\nScreen media use\nScreen time was measured using self-report of the amount of time on a typical day youth used recreational screen media categories and total time spent. The following instructions were given for this section:\n\nPlease do NOT include time spent on school related work, but DO include watching TV, shows or videos, texting or chatting, playing games, or visiting social networking sites.\n\nDue to the likelihood that many youth would likely be at home throughout most of these assessments, screen time was not captured for both a typical weekday and a typical weekend day independently, as is done in the ABCD annual data collections. There are school variables to account for whether the youth was attending school in person.\nFor the first three waves the response answers were 0 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 mins, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 2.5 hours, and then each whole hour through 24 hours. It should be noted that depending on the type of device the youth used to complete the survey, there may be errors, particularly at the higher end, due to the way the answer options appeared; for example, if a child chose 1 hour, they may have accidentally spun the wheel to the end and clicked to try to get out of the answer option, rather than to mean to select 24 hours. This can be seen in instances where a child reports 24 hours of “Play multiplayer video games …” but only 5 hours of total screen time on a typical day.\n\n\nCOVID-19 attitudes and practices\nThese items assessed youth attitudes, practices, knowledge, and knowledge sources about COVID-19. Responses on youth attitudes toward COVID-19 policies (e.g., mask-wearing, school closures) may have been influenced by external social and familial factors. Researchers should consider potential confounding variables when interpreting results.\nMeasures beginning with the prefix covid_y_qtn__safety have responses on a Likert scale from 1 to 4. For example, for covid_y_qtn__safety_003 (“I wear a mask over my face or protective gear (e.g., gloves, things to cover my clothes)”, response options were:\n\n1 I have not done this in the last week\n2 I did this some of the time last week\n3 I did this most of the time last week\n4 I did this all the time last week\n\nResponses across these 13 measures were available for Wave 1 and Wave 3. The measures showed reasonable distributions across the Likert scale. Some measures of daily responses showed substantial change across these first two timepoints (e.g., covid_y_qtn__safety_010), indicating potential sensitivity to changes in local pandemic rules or behaviors in early months of the pandemic. Other measures of attitudes showed similar score distributions across the two time points (e.g., covid_y_qtn__emotion_001), indicating potentially more stable traits resilient to changes in local pandemic rules or behaviors.\nThese responses were reasonably distributed, except for covid_y_qtn__media_004, which was skewed toward “0, Once per day or less”, indicating most youth were not reporting checking for news updates.\nSimilarly, youth overwhelmingly endorsed “None” for the question:\ncovid_y_qtn__media_005 - Which platform did you use the most when checking for news related to coronavirus?\n\n1 Twitter\n2 Instagram\n3 TikTok\n4 Snapchat\n5 YouTube\n6 Reddit\n7 Facebook\n8 Other\n9 None\n\n\n\nProtests\nIn May and June 2020, ABCD youth (ages 11-13) experienced public demonstrations and protests across the U.S., and during this period, youth were navigating public health restrictions related to COVID-19. These events were associated with various social and policy issues and were widely covered by media outlets. The following questions were added to the COVID survey (waves 4 and 5) to assess youth’s experience and perceptions about protests for or against Black Lives Matters, police, mask mandates, and school and business closures.\nQuestions about Black Lives Matter protests have the designation blm. Questions about protests supporting police have the designation pol. Questions about protests against wearing masks have the designation anti_mask or against_mask. Questions about protests in favor of reopening businesses have the designation reopbus.\nFor each of the four protest types, youth were first asked if they: watched TV stories, looked on the internet, or listened to news on the radio about public demonstrations (public marches, rallies).\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm…\ncovid_y_qtn__pol…\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask…\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus…\n\nIf youth endorsed this item, they were asked follow-up questions about the amount of time (0= none, 1= &lt;30 minutes per day 2= 30 minutes-1 hour per day, 3= 1-5 hours per day, 4= &gt;5 hours per day) they spent engaging with media…\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_001__01\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_001__01\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_001__01\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_001__01\n\n…and how they felt (angry, afraid, inspired, hopeful) when engaging (1=not at all, 2= a little, 3=somewhat, 4=very much).\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_001__02 to __05\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_001__02 to __05\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_001__02 to __05\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_001__02 to __05\n\nYouth were then asked if they scrolled, wrote, or posted to social media about the demonstrations (public marches, rallies)\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_002\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_002\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_002\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_002\n\nIf youth endorsed this item, they were asked follow-up questions about how often they scrolled/posted (0= none, 1= 1-10 times, 2= 11-30 times, 3= 31-50 times, 4= over 50 times)…\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_002__01\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_002__01\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_002__01\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_002__01\n\n…and how they felt (angry, afraid, inspired, hopeful) when scrolling/posting (1=not at all, 2= a little, 3=somewhat, 4=very much) - covid_y_qtn__blm_002__02 to __05 - covid_y_qtn__pol_002__02 to __05 - covid_y_qtn__antimask_002__02 to __05 - covid_y_qtn__reopbus_002__02 to __05\nYouth were then asked if they knew people who attended a public demonstration (public marches, rallies) without them.\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_003\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_003\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_003\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_003\n\nIf youth endorsed this item, they were asked follow-up questions about who attended (parents, siblings, friends or neighbors).\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_003__01 and __02\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_003__01 and __02\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_003__01 and __02\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_003__01 and __02\n\nIf youth endorsed having a parent or sibling attend a demonstration without them, they were asked how they felt (afraid, proud) if parents or siblings attended (1=not at all, 2= a little, 3=somewhat, 4=very much).\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_003__01__01 and __02\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_003__01__01 and __02\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_003__01__01 and __02\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_003__01__01 and __02\n\nFinally, youth were asked how many demonstrations (public marches, rallies) they attended (0= 0, 1= 1, 2= 2, 3= 3 or more).\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_004\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_004\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_004\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_004\n\nIf youth endorsed a non-zero value, they were asked follow-up questions about how they felt when attending (angry, afraid, inspired, hopeful)… - covid_y_qtn__blm_004__01 to __04 - covid_y_qtn__pol_004__01 to __04 - covid_y_qtn__antimask_004__01 to __04 - covid_y_qtn__reopbus_004__01 to __04\n…and what they saw when attending (police helping or protecting a demonstrator, demonstrator helping or protecting a demonstrator, force by police (pushing, shoving or use of tear gas), violence by demonstrators (throwing rocks, bottles at police, destroying property).\n\ncovid_y_qtn__blm_005\ncovid_y_qtn__pol_005\ncovid_y_qtn__antimask_005\ncovid_y_qtn__reopbus_005\n\n\n\nCoping behaviors\nA new question (covid_y_qtn__cope…) asked about activities in the past week such as learning a new hobby. Participants could check all activities that applied.\n\n\nMental health and stress\nNIH Toolbox Emotion Measures: Youth-reported measures of sadness (8 items), fear (8 items), and positive affect (9 items) were measured using instruments from the NIH Emotion Battery (Gershon et al. (2013)). Youth were asked on a scale from “Never” to “Almost Always” how often they had felt a particular emotional experience. One additional item was added, “I felt angry or frustrated”, to measure anger emotion, with identical response options to the NIH Toolbox emotion measures.\nCOVID-Related Worry: Five questions were constructed to measure worry and their thinking about the coronavirus. These included asking youth how worried they have been about the coronavirus; how worried others have been; how much life has changed as a result of coronavirus; how hopeful youth are that the coronavirus crisis will end soon; and how stressful the uncertainty of COVID-19 has been on their lives. Response options ranged from “Not at all” to “Extremely.”\nPerceived Stress: Perceived stress was measured using the 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein (1983)). Youth were asked to indicate how often they experienced stress in the past month. Response options ranged from “Never” to “Very Often”.\nA second item was constructed to measure how much a youth’s perceived mental well-being has changed in the past week, ranging from “much worse” to “much better.”\nReferences:\n\nGershon et al. (2013)\nCohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein (1983)\n\n\n\nFriends and family relationships\nParental Knowledge/Monitoring - In wave 1-7, youth completed four items measuring parental knowledge / monitoring:\n\ncovid_y_qtn__famrel_001\ncovid_y_qtn__famrel_002\ncovid_y_qtn__famrel_003\ncovid_y_qtn__famrel_004\n\nThese are four of the five items included on the ABCD study’s measure of parental monitoring at the main study visits. See Zucker et al. (2018) for a description of the measure.\nAt wave 7 only, youth completed three additional items:\n\ncovid_y_qtn__su_001\ncovid_y_qtn__su_001__01\ncovid_y_qtn__su_002\n\nThe items were written for ABCD to measure parents’ knowledge and monitoring of youths’ substance use. Within the survey, these items were placed immediately after the survey section asking the youth about his or her alcohol or drug use. The items assess (1) whether parents knew about any youth substance use that occurred, (2) if the parents knew, whether they made any change to their monitoring or tracking of the youth, and (3) whether the youth could think of an instance in which they would have used substances if not for parent interference.\nThese survey items were written by William Pelham, PhD at UC San Diego. Contact wpelham@ucsd.edu with further questions.\nReference: Zucker et al. (2018)\n\n\nFamily and friend communication quality\nYouth were asked how the frequency and tone of their communications with their parents, siblings, and friends had changed during the pandemic.\nReference: Zucker et al. (2018)\n\n\nSubstance use\nYouth were asked how many days in the last 30 days they had used alcohol, nicotine products, inhalants, marijuana in various forms, and other substances. Youth were also asked about their parents’ knowledge and monitoring of their substance use.\n\n\nMedia and news exposure\nYouth were asked about their exposure to news about COVID-19, whether they sought out news about COVID-19, and what their news sources were.",

They generally will have consistent keywords across sections but may not contain all the same keywords. To learn more about keywords see our documentation on variable naming conventions.\n\nFamily situation\nCaregivers were asked about home composition, family members’ jobs and related COVID risk, economic impacts of the pandemic, including food insecurity, other family impacts (e.g., family conflict, access to medical/mental healthcare), and family COVID illness.\n\n\nSchooling\nParents were asked about school closure and school attendance of their children, how much time their child spent on school/schoolwork, whether they have access to needed materials for school, how they engaged with their school’s curriculum, and whether they received school-related services (e.g., meals).\nThe parents who reported being the primary (or co-primary) person responsible for child’s care during the day were asked questions about how much those activities interfered with their professional and household duties. Further questions addressed how much time they spent in helping the children in their school activities along with other questions regarding the continuity of schooling.\nWaves 2 and 3 covered at least partially schools’ summer break for a large number of participants.\n\n\nYouth’s routine\nDaily routines: Parents were asked whether family routines had changed due to the pandemic.\nSleep: Seven questions about sleep are from the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) (Bruni et al. (1996)), specifically from the Disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep subscale. The period has been modified to the past week. Two questions that quantify sleep duration and sleep onset latency are asked at each time point whereas the remaining 5 questions about difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (responses range from Never to Always on a 5-point Likert scale) are asked on wave 2. The 7 items (each scored between 1 and 5) can be added to obtain a total score for difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, with higher scores reflecting greater difficulty.\nThe Sleep Disturbance Scale is included in the main ABCD Study assessment protocol (ph_p_sds) allowing users to compare pre- and post-COVID patterns.\nPhysical activity - Questions about moderate-vigorous physical activity in the past week are modified from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form (Lee et al. (2011)).\nReferences:\n\nBruni et al. (1996)\nLee et al. (2011)\n\n\n\nCOVID attitudes and practices\nCaregivers were asked whether the virus has elicited strong emotions or gotten in the way of the youth’s enjoyment of life on a four-point Likert scale. Caregivers were asked about parental involvement , ’Talked About X, in the past week at each wave using five-point Likert scale items (1, Never; 2, Rarely; 3, Occasionally; 4, Frequently; 5, Very Frequently).\nMissing data were minimal as a percentage of responses and distributions were reasonable. Remaining measures assessing parent involvement, using 5-point “Strongly Disagree-Strongly Agree” Likert were asked at two timepoints (Wave 1 and 3) and showed reasonable distributions.\nA question was constructed asking about activities the family engaged in or avoided in the past week by choice, rather than because of closures. In Surveys 1 and 2, participants had the option of checking up to 13 boxes with different COVID related activities. A checkbox corresponding to “None of the above” added (covid_p_qtn_006___333). On wave 3, an additional checkbox was added (covid_p_qtn_006___14) corresponding to the item “Wore Masks”.\nData for covid_p_qtn_006… should be disregarded for wave 1 and 2 as only a few participants who took the survey later on had covid_p_qtn_006___333 as an available option.\n\n\nCoping behaviors\nA question was constructed asking about activities the parent engaged in the past week to cope (covid_p_qtn_007…). Participants had the option of selecting up to 8 checkboxes. covid_p_qtn_007___333 corresponds to the checkbox “None of the above”.\n\n\nMedia and news exposure\nParents were asked about youth exposure to news about COVID-19 and whether the virus has elicited strong emotions or gotten in the way of the youth’s enjoyment of life.\nFor youth news exposure at the first time point, for 16 participants there was a potential branching logic glitch, resulting in 16 missing data points for:\n\ncovid_p_qtn__media_001\ncovid_p_qtn__media_002\n\n\n\nParent substance use\nParents were asked about how often and where they used alcohol, marijuana, nicotine products, and other substances.\nIn Surveys 2, 4, and 6, certain substance use questions (covid_p_qtn__su__nic__vape_001, covid_p_qtn__su__mj__vape_001, covid_p_qtn__su__mj__smoke_001, and covid_p_qtn__su__nic__cig_001) were administered conditionally based on prior responses, following a structured branching logic design. If a question was not asked due to branching logic is is coded under the suffix ___888.\n\n\nYouth’s COVID-19 infection\nParents were asked about the youth’s COVID symptoms, diagnosis and testing, or any exacerbation of asthma symptoms.",

We used v2.1 to create the historical data from Jan 1, 2019 - Dec 31, 2019 (the backfill) as well as the data from May 10, 2020 forwards. However, the Jan 1-May 9, 2020 data is on v2.0. Apologies for any inconvenience, please see Release Notes below for more information.*\n\n\nThe data was generated using a panel of GPS pings from anonymous mobile devices. We determined the common nighttime location of each mobile device over a 6-week period to a Geohash-7 granularity (~153m x ~153m). For ease of reference, we call this common nighttime location, the device’s “home”. We then aggregate the devices by home census block group and provide the metrics set out below for each census block group.*\n\nAcross devices, variable suffixes disttravel refer to median distance traveled from home (with “home” defined as described above), and homedwell refers to the average amount of time (in minutes) at home. devathome refers to the proportion of devices completely at home. ftwork and ptwork refer to the proportion of devices exhibiting full-time and part-time, respectively, work behavior. Full-time work is defined as the ratio of devices polled that spent greater than 6 hours at a location other than their geohash-7 home during the period of 8am - 6pm in local time. Part-time work is defined as the ratio of devices polled that spent one period of between 3 and 6 hours at one location other than their geohash- 7 home during the period of 8am - 6pm in local time. This does not include any device that spent 6 or more hours at a location other than home.\nFor additional notes, see Geocoded Data - Administrative information.",

Raw EARS data have not undergone such procedures. Data users are advised to use the raw data files with caution and only with full understanding of the underlying data collected. Summary variables are recommended for most users.\nFor users interested in examining the raw data or when summary tabulated variables do not serve their research needs, the following files are provided. Each measure (e.g., app usage) has its own file containing every participant’s instance of smartphone use measured, across ABCD time points. Files are provided in .csv and parquet format, and include:\n\nears_appusage_feat: Gain insights into which applications are used and for how long per calendar date.\nears_appusage_logs: Dive deeper into application usage with detailed logs on app use and duration within short collection windows.\nears_keyinput_feat: Analyze keyboard usage patterns with data on duration per app and calendar date.\nears_keyinput_sess: Identify and understand sessions of continuous keyboard use within specific applications.\nears_screenon_feat: Access screen-on time metrics to gain a broader understanding of device usage patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing .parquet files without reading them into memory\n\n\n\nThe EARS raw data files are comparatively large and need sufficient resources to be loaded into memory in entirety. An efficient way to work with these files without loading them into memory is to use the R package duckplyr which allows to query, filter, and summarize data directly from the parquet files without loading them into memory.\n\n\nIn addition, there were a handful of participants with a unique edge case causing all their key input timestamps session timestamp variables to be midnight. It did not influence downstream feature values, but was still remediated before creating summary variables. As a result, participants in Years 4-6 have reprocessed key input timestamps data in the ears_feature_data tables (with corresponding INSERT and DELETE actions in the table history).\n\n\n\nEARS — Device Usage Applications Data Dictionary\n\nDescription of data dictionary\nIncluded in the 6.0 data release are data dictionaries detailing individual applications used to calculate variables in the Summary Tabulated Device Usage Statistics. Six dictionaries are provided; brief descriptions of each are included below. Files include:\n\ntbl_dict_app_android: Provides individual Android OS applications and the respective categories (e.g., entertainment apps) they were grouped under in the summary tabulated scores (see EARS Device Usage Statistics).\ntbl_dict_app_ios: Provides individual iOS applications and the respective categories (e.g., entertainment apps) they were grouped under in the summary tabulated scores (see EARS Device Usage Statistics).\ntbl_dict_app_exclusion & tbl_dict_app_system: Provides a list of applications excluded from summary score calculations (e.g., systems apps or background apps that run continuously).\ntbl_dict_categories_android: Provides a summary list of the application categories for Android OS users.\ntbl_dict_categories_ios: Provides a summary list of the application categories for iOS users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData dictionaries for EARS summary score computation\n\n\n\n\n\ntbl_dict_app_android  tbl_dict_app_android.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntbl_dict_app_ios  tbl_dict_app_ios.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntbl_dict_app_exclusions  tbl_dict_app_exclusions.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntbl_dict_app_system  tbl_dict_app_system.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntbl_dict_categories_android  tbl_dict_categories_android.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntbl_dict_categories_ios  tbl_dict_categories_ios.csv \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPilot Study – EARS raw data\n\nDescription of data\nDuring planning for the rollout of a real-time screen time use app, ABCD performed pilot testingat 4 ABCD study sites using EARS from Ksana Health. The full EARS pilot protocol lasted for 4 weeks.\nThe following describes the data available from the pilot study of the EARS app. Data are available in both summary tabulated form and in raw (i.e., logs of every instance of app use by participant) form. In tabulated form, the data are similar to the future iterations of the full ABCD passive sensing protocol. Namely, the Google Play Categories are provided with summary times over the length of the passive sensing protocol (in the pilot, 4 full weeks). In addition, Ksana Health created composite app categories based on a list created by the Novel Tech Workgroup. These composite categories are described as “ABCD composite categories” (e.g., Gaming, Communications). They do not take into consideration the Google Play Store category, but were labeled based on Ksana’s judgment on how the app would best be categorized. Given the very large number of participants and apps used, this ABCD composite category process was not used beyond the initial pilot study, though ABCD Google Playstore Categories are provided in the full ABCD EARS protocol.\nDetailed pilot study information is published: Wade et al. (2021)",

Thus, they should not be considered a “clinical diagnosis.”\nMental health diagnoses and experiences with mental health care can be influenced by myriad factors (e.g., culture, background) that could impact the interpretation of items (symptoms) It is important to understand whether scales and individual mental health measures function similarly across groups by examining measurement invariance, and explicitly acknowledging potential sources of invariance, their impact on measure performance, and/or any interpretation limitations that may stem from the use of a given measure.\nWhen writing about mental health symptoms or diagnoses, it is important to use person-centered language (e.g., person with anxiety). An exception to this is in the area of autism, where there is ongoing dialogue within the affected community about preferred language. Language choices should be informed by both scientific consensus and input from individuals with lived experience with the condition of focus.

One subscale corresponds to the BIS and has seven items that contribute to this score (e.g., “Criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit”). The remaining three subscales correspond to three components of BAS (Drive, Reward Responsiveness, and Fun Seeking). BAS Drive measures the motivation to follow one’s goals and has four items that contribute to this score (e.g., “When I want something I usually go all-out to get it”). BAS Reward Responsiveness measures the sensitivity to pleasant reinforcers in the environment and has four items that contribute to this score (e.g., “It would excite me to win a contest”). BAS Fun Seeking measures the motivation to find novel rewards spontaneously has five items that contribute to this score (e.g., “I crave excitement and new sensations”).

    "section": "Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children (KSADS-COMP)",
    "text": "Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children (KSADS-COMP)\nThe KSADS is a semi-structured interview to measure current and past symptoms of mood, anxiety, psychotic, and disruptive behavior disorders, among others, in children ages 6-18 years old. It was designed to promote earlier diagnosis of mental disorders in children in a way that incorporates reports by both the child and parent. The KSADS-COMP is a computerized version of the KSADS. It is administered in diagnostic category modules described below.\nThe following levels are used for symptoms and diagnoses:\n-1 = present\n-0 = absent\n-888 = Question not asked due to primary question response (branching logic)\n-555 = Not administered in the assessment\nWe switched to the KSADS 2.0 at the 3-year follow-up for both parent and youth report as this updated version incorporates several improved features, including better assessments of Autism Spectrum and Psychotic disorders. These KSADS tables include both data from 1.0 and 2.0 for the same variables in the same columns for ease of analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKSADS-COMP Changes 1.0 to 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May of 2021, the KSADS-COMP originators did a review of diagnostic criteria used in the programming algorithms and found several errors that likely led to overestimates of diagnoses for several disorders. The needed modifications are: a) include impairment in the diagnostic criteria for Major Depression and Persistent Depressive Disorder; b) include onset before age 10 in the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorders; c) require impairment in two domains, not just one, for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; d) require an illness duration of 6 months or more for Agoraphobia; e) include an illness duration of three months or longer for Anorexia; and f) include the presence of all three criterion A symptoms for Autism (relevant to the 2.0 version). Prior releases of ABCD Study data in these diagnostic domains were impacted by these issues (i.e. Release 4.0 and before). KSADS-COMP completed these modifications and the corrected diagnostic data from these categories is included in Release 5.0 and beyond.\nThe Conduct Disorder module of the KSADS was modified such that all youth are asked all the potential behavioral indicators of Conduct Disorder (except the sexual conduct symptom), and the Callous and Unemotional trait questions are asked of any youth who endorse one or more Conduct Disorder indicators.\n\nBranching algorithm for the screen interview and supplement items changed, so that if a threshold level response is provided to a given symptom, the interview moves to the next item. The past item is only queried if subthreshold responses are given to the current item. This streamlines the assessment for subjects.\nAdditional questions were added to the end of the supplements to determine the patterning of symptoms within each diagnostic category, if more than one episode of a disorder occurred, and if disorder is current, in partial remission, full remission, or a past episode. This refined episode classifications.\nInformation was added to the diagnostic algorithms to determine if a child was on medication for that diagnosis (e.g., ADHD). Diagnostic classifications were added to reflect this, e.g., current diagnosis, asymptomatic on medication, or partial remission on medication.\nThe probe for the hallucinations item was made more rigorous and requires hallucinatory-like experiences to occur during the day while the youth is going about their daily activities. The majority of false positive self-administered KSADS-COMP psychotic disorder screenscame from youth who only had these experiences at nighttime before going to bed, with these cases ruled out in the clinician-administered KSADS-COMP.\nAdditional false positive screens into the psychotic disorders supplement came from youth who reported paranoid ideation. This item has been moved from the screen to the supplement to avoid children with bullying experiences or youth who live in dangerous neighborhoods from unnecessarily screening into the psychotic disorders section.\nBipolar Disorder screen – the item about hypersexuality was moved to the supplement to minimize false positive screens.\nBack button was added\nOCD was another diagnosis that youth screened into the supplement more often with the self-administered KSADS-COMP than the clinician administered KSADS-COMP. To reduce the number of youth entering the OCD supplement unnecessarily the following changes were made:\n\na screen item was added to capture duration of OCD-like symptoms, with sufficient duration (more than half the days of the week) required to meet entry criteria for completing the OCD supplement; and\nthe obsessive thoughts about sex item was moved to the supplement as the greatest number of false screen-positives was youth who reported excessive thoughts about sex – a common experience among adolescents.\nthe wording of the initial probe for obsession (1.11.1.q1) was revised to include wording about thoughts being “unwelcome, distressing, and senseless”\n\nAdditional diagnostic categories derived in 2.0 that that were not available in 1.0 include: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and autism spectrum disorder (parent report only)\n\nDiagnostic Algorithm Errors Detected and Updated in 2021:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnoses\nModifications Required\n\n\nMajor Depression/Persistent Depression Disorder\nIncluding impairment in the diagnostic criteria\n\n\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\nIncluding onset before the age of 10 in the diagnostic criteria\n\n\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\nOther specified bipolar disorder added as rule out for DMDD\n\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\nRequiring impairment in functioning in two, not one domain\n\n\nAgoraphobia\nIncluding duration of illness 6 months or more\n\n\nEnuresis/Encopresis\nIncluding minimum ages for diagnoses\n\n\nAnorexia\nIncluding duration of illness 3 months or more\n\n\nAutism – Criterion A\nRequiring the presence of all three criterion A symptoms for the disorder\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nTownsend et al.

For example, a participant indicates that they don’t know about any biological relatives (mh_p_famhx_001 = 0), so items assessing depression in father and and all other relatives are blank and could be considered missing.\nThe respondent indicates that no biological relative had that problem so follow-up questions are not asked. For example, a participant indicates they know about their biological relatives (mh_p_famhx_001 = 1) but none had depression (mh_p_famhx__dep_001 = 0). In this case, the blank response can be assumed to indicate the absence of depression (i.e., a zero).\nThe relative does not exist. For example, the participant has 1 paternal uncle, so response to paternal uncle 2 is blank. Number and type of biological relatives can be found in variables mh_p_famhx__mat__unc_001 – to– mh_p_famhx__half__old_001.\nThe Research Assistant did not administer questions pertaining to all biological relatives because the participant or parent had knowledge of the biological relatives,indicated that one or more relative had the problem, but was asked to respond only to questions about relatives they knew were affected, rather than indicating “no problems” for relatives not affected. For example, a respondent was asked about problems due to alcohol (e.g., marital separation or divorce) only for the affected relative. The respondent has knowledge of the youth’s biological relatives, one or more relatives is believed to have a problem due to alcohol, but there is no endorsement of “no problems” for the father (mh_p_famhx__alc__fath_001___0), no endorsement of any specific problem (mh_p_famhx__alc__fath_001___1 – mh_p_famhx__alc__fath_001___6), and no endorsement of “don’t know” (mh_p_famhx__alc__fath_001___999). In this example, one can presume the absence of a problem related to alcohol in the father.\n\nReferences:\n\nBrown et al. (2015)\nRice et al. (1995)",

    "text": "Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children (KSADS-COMP)\nThe KSADS-COMP is a computerized version of the KSADS given to parents about their youth participant.\nThe KSADS is a semi-structured interview to measure current and past symptoms of mood, anxiety, psychotic, and disruptive behavior disorders, among others, in children ages 6-18 years old. It was designed to promote earlier diagnosis of mental disorders in children in a way that incorporates reports by both the child and parent. The KSADS-COMP is a computerized version of the KSADS. It is administered in diagnostic category modules described below.\nThe following levels are used for symptoms and diagnoses:\n\n1 = present\n0 = absent\n888 = Question not asked due to primary question response (branching logic)\n555 = Not administered in the assessment\n\nWe switched to the KSADS 2.0 at the 3-year follow-up for both parent and youth report as this updated version incorporates several improved features, including better assessments of Autism Spectrum and Psychotic disorders. These KSADS tables include both data from 1.0 and 2.0 for the same variables in the same columns for ease of analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKSADS-COMP Changes 1.0 to 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May of 2021, the KSADS-COMP originators did a review of diagnostic criteria used in the programming algorithms and found several errors that likely led to overestimates of diagnoses for several disorders. The needed modifications are: a) include impairment in the diagnostic criteria for Major Depression and Persistent Depressive Disorder; b) include onset before age 10 in the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorders; c) require impairment in two domains, not just one, for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; d) require an illness duration of 6 months or more for Agoraphobia; e) include an illness duration of three months or longer for Anorexia; and f) include the presence of all three criterion A symptoms for Autism (relevant to the 2.0 version). Prior releases of ABCD Study data in these diagnostic domains were impacted by these issues (i.e. Release 4.0 and before). KSADS-COMP completed these modifications and the corrected diagnostic data from these categories is included in Release 5.0 and beyond.\nThe Conduct Disorder module of the KSADS was modified such that all youth are asked all the potential behavioral indicators of Conduct Disorder (except the sexual conduct symptom), and the Callous and Unemotional trait questions are asked of any youth who endorse one or more Conduct Disorder indicators.\n\nBranching algorithm for the screen interview and supplement items changed, so that if a threshold level response is provided to a given symptom, the interview moves to the next item. The past item is only queried if subthreshold responses are given to the current item. This streamlines the assessment for participants.\nAdditional questions were added to the end of the supplements to determine the patterning of symptoms within each diagnostic category, if more than one episode of a disorder occurred, and if disorder is current, in partial remission, full remission, or a past episode. This refined episode classifications.\nInformation was added to the diagnostic algorithms to determine if a child was on medication for that diagnosis (e.g., ADHD). Diagnostic classifications were added to reflect this, e.g., current diagnosis, asymptomatic on medication, or partial remission on medication.\nThe probe for the hallucinations item was made more rigorous and requires hallucinatory-like experiences to occur during the day while the youth is going about their daily activities. The majority of false positive self-administered KSADS-COMP psychotic disorder screen positives came from youth who only had these experiences at nighttime before going to bed, with these cases ruled out in the clinician-administered KSADS-COMP.\nAdditional false positive screens into the psychotic disorders supplement came from youth who reported paranoid ideation. This item has been moved from the screen to the supplement to avoid children with bullying experiences or youth who live in dangerous neighborhoods from unnecessarily screening into the psychotic disorders section.\nBipolar Disorder screen – Item about hypersexuality was moved to the supplement to minimize false positive screens.\nOCD was another diagnosis that youth screened into the supplement more often with the self-administered KSADS-COMP than the clinician administered KSADS-COMP. To reduce the number of youth entering the OCD supplement unnecessarily the following changes were made:\n\na screen item was added to capture duration of OCD-like symptoms, with sufficient duration (more than half the days of the week) required to meet entry criteria for completing the OCD supplement; and\nthe obsessive thoughts about sex item was moved to the supplement as the greatest number of false screen-positives was youth who reported excessive thoughts about sex – a common experience among adolescents.\nthe wording of the initial probe for obsession (1.11.1.q1) was revised to include wording about thoughts being “unwelcome, distressing, and senseless”\n\nAdditional diagnostic categories derived in 2.0 that that were not available in 1.0 include: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and autism spectrum disorder (parent report only).\nBack button added\n\nDiagnostic Algorithm Errors Detected and Updated in 2021:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnoses\nModifications Required\n\n\nMajor Depression/Persistent Depression Disorder\nIncluding impairment in the diagnostic criteria\n\n\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\nIncluding onset before the age of 10 in the diagnostic criteria\n\n\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder\nOther specified bipolar disorder added as rule out for DMDD\n\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\nRequiring impairment in functioning in two, not one domain\n\n\nAgoraphobia\nIncluding duration of illness 6 months or more\n\n\nEnuresis/Encopresis\nIncluding minimum ages for diagnoses\n\n\nAnorexia\nIncluding duration of illness 3 months or more\n\n\nAutism – Criterion A\nRequiring the presence of all three criterion A symptoms for the disorder\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nTownsend et al.

However, response options were limited to fairly typical grade levels for each age, so participants who are quite ahead or behind typical grades for their age are not offered all response options. For example, for age, response options are 8th grade and lower grades. For age 18, response options are K–12. Very few respondents did not see their grade as a response option; those who did not see their grade were instructed to select the closest grade.\nKSADS – Depressive Disorders (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__dep\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia), and Other Specified Depressive Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__dmdd\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of non-episodic irritability and frequent severe temper outbursts for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Eating Disorders (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__ed\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, and Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Generalized Anxiety Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__gad\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Homicidality (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__hom\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Homicidality for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__ocd\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Oppositional Defiant Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__odd\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Oppositional Defiant Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Panic Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__panic\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Panic Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__ptsd\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Other Specified Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorder, and the various Adjustment Disorders for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Psychotic Disorders (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__psych\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Schizophrenia, Other Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, Hallucinations, and Delusions for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Separation Anxiety Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__sepanx\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Separation Anxiety Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Sleep Problems (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__sleep\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Sleep Problems for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Social Anxiety Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__socanx\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Social Anxiety Disorder and Other Specified Anxiety Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Specific Phobia Disorder (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__phobia\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Specific Phobia Disorder for their youth participant.\nKSADS – Suicidality (Parent)\n mh_p_ksads__suic\nMeasure description: Parent assessment of Suicidality for their youth participant.\nNotes and special considerations: Suicide in the 4-year follow-up and beyond is only asking about current and not lifetime.",

    "text": "Short Social Responsiveness Scale\n mh_p_ssrs  score documentation\nMeasure description: Identifies the presence and severity of social impairment within the autism spectrum.\nNotes and special considerations: The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was originally developed as a screener (John N. Constantino and Todd 2003, 2000; John N. Constantino et al. 2004; John N. Constantino 2011; J. N. Constantino et al. 2000), and so the behaviors it measures are relevant but not specific to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a result, scores at least partially reflect certain characteristics, such as problem behaviors and low IQ, that cannot be uniformly considered at the individual level as symptoms of ASD (Hus et al. 2013; Aldridge et al. 2012; Norris and Lecavalier 2010). Further, the results of several studies suggest that the population-level distribution of the construct measured by the SRS in individuals without ASD is not continuous, but rather a mixture of at least two non-normal distributions (Kaat and Farmer 2017).\nPractically, these features suggest at least three precautions. First, the influence of non-ASD characteristics (e.g. problem behaviors and low IQ) is most relevant when there is no clinical concern of ASD for the subject of the ratings, as there is a significant possibility that the scores reflect the non-ASD characteristics, rather than ASD symptoms. Second, for individuals where ASD is a clinical concern, interpretation of scores should consider problem behaviors, language level, and IQ. Third, the interpretation of the raw score as an indicator of ASD symptom severity in people without ASD should take into consideration the concerns raised above.\nNote that autism levels 2 (“Requiring substantial support”) and 3 (“Requiring very substantial support”) were exclusion criteria during recruitment for the ABCD Study.\nReferences:\n\nAldridge et al.

Hybrid spatiotemporal models were used to create daily estimates for PM2.5, ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for the birth years [2004-2009] at a resolution of 1 km2 [1-3]. The daily estimates of these air pollution exposures during the prenatal period of each participant were assigned to the corresponding reported birth year address(es), and daily estimates were averaged across the entire prenatal period to represent the prenatal exposure. For study participants with multiple self-reported addresses for the same calendar year, a weighted average of air pollution exposure was calculated in order to provide a single estimated exposure value for every participant. This was calculated by weighting the prenatal average exposure values for each residence by the reported percent of time spent at that residence; the sum of these weighted exposure averages was then divided by the sum of all reported percentages (regardless of total sum of time between addresses) (Eq 1).\nWeighted Average = (Air PollutionAddress_1 * Percent timeAddress_1) + (Air PollutionAddress_2 * Percent timeAddress_2) / (Percent timeAddress_1 + Percent time Address_2)\nThe majority of participants (7,837 [91%]) had reported an address(es) corresponding to the calendar year congruent with the child’s birth year as well as the reported percentages of time spent at each address summed to 100%. For a subset of participants (806 [9%]), errors occurred in the reporting of addresses or percentages of time spent at each address, including 386 [4%] participants who reported percentages of time at multiple addresses that did not sum to 100% and 420 [5%] participants who reported addresses with no corresponding percent of time spent living at that address. Given these reporting errors, it is unclear exactly how much time was spent at various addresses during the exposure period, thus introducing uncertainty in exposure classification.\nIn order to convey this uncertainty, a quality control (qc) variable was created in order to rank prenatal data according to how accurate we expect the air pollution exposure weighted average to be. This qc variable, le_l_prenatal_qc is defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nle_l_prenatal_qc\nMeaning\nNumber of Participants (Percent)\n\n\n\n\n1\nReported percentages at all addresses sum to 100%\n7837 (90.67%)\n\n\n2\nReported percentages at all addresses sum to totals ranging from 90 to 110%\n70 (0.81%)\n\n\n3\nReported percentages at all addresses sum to totals less than 90% or greater than 110%\n316 (3.66%)\n\n\n4\nReported percentages at addresses were missing\n420 (4.86%)\n\n\n\nFor more information on how residential histories were obtained see as reported in Fan et al. (2021).\nNotes and Special Considerations: A number of assumptions and limitations of these data should be noted and highlighted in research and publications that use these derived ABCD data.\n\nFirst, ABCD did not specifically ask caregivers where they resided when pregnant or if addresses changed during pregnancy, but rather addresses reported during a given calendar year and coinciding with the participant’s birth year were considered representative for the pregnancy period.\nSecond, caregivers were only asked to provide move-in and move-out information in terms of calendar year, without month information provided. Thus, chronological sequence of addresses that overlap within a given year can not be deciphered and this error may factor into the weight sum scores computed above.\nThe weighted sum equation was applied to all individuals regardless if their provided sum living in a location did or did not add to 100%. The error inherent to this approach can be reduced by only including individuals with a le_l_prenatal_qc variable equal to 1 in analyses using these data.\nThe approach used above assigns a prenatal exposure based on daily exposures over the 9-months prior to a child’s birthdate. This approach assumes all children were delivered full-term, which is not necessarily true. It may be best to limit the sample of participants in analyses using these data that can be confirmed to have been in utero for full-term using caregiver report information provided about the child’s medical history in other portions of the ABCD dataset (ph_p_dhx).\n\nReferences:\n\nDi et al.

The model capitalized on acoustical data from 1.5 million hours of long-term measurements from 492 urban and rural sites located across the contiguous United States during 2000-2014. Geospatial sound models were developed based on these measurements to interpret and predict sound levels across the contiguous United States (D. Mennitt et al. (2013); D. J. Mennitt and Fristrup (2016)). This geospatial sound model formulated relationships between sparsely measured acoustical metrics and nonacoustic environmental factors such as topography, climate, hydrology, and anthropogenic activity. The method utilized random forest, a tree-based machine learning algorithm, to perform the regression. The resulting non-time-varying geospatial sound model enabled mapping of sound levels at 270m resolution.\nAll noise metrics are A-weighted. A-weighting is an adjustment that reflects how the human ear perceives sound across the frequency spectrum.\n\nThe L10 is an exceedance metric that corresponds to the sound pressure level exceeded 10% of the time.\nThe L50 is an exceedance metric that corresponds to the sound pressure level exceeded 50% of the time.\nThe L90 is an exceedance metric that corresponds to the sound pressure level exceeded 90% of the time.\nLeq is the average sound level in decibels equivalent to the total sound energy measured in a 24-hour period;\nLeqNight isthe average sound level in from the hours of 10p-7a; and\nLdn, is the day-night average sound level, which is the average sound level over a 24-hour period where sound from 10pm-7am is upweighted by 10 dB.\nClarification: The noise level measurements between the hours of 10pm and 7am are artificially increased by 10 dB before averaging. This noise is weighted to take into account the decrease in community background noise of 10 dB during this period. For more information about similar metrics of sound day-evening-night average sound level (DENL) commonly used in Europe or community noise exposure level (CNEL) used in California legislation; that is, the DNL with the addition of an evening period from 7 PM to 10 PM when noise level measurements are boosted 5 dB to account for the approximate decrease in background community noise by 5 dB during this period.\nVariables ending in _ant ant is anthropogenic, and _exi is total noise (anthropogenic and natural) sources. Natural sources alone were not included given the limited variability seen within largely urban locations in which most participants reside.\n\nNotes and Special Considerations: A number of assumptions and limitations of these data should be noted and highlighted in research and publications that use these derived ABCD data.\n\nSources of the noise are not identifiable based on these models, since the source and sound level is assumed to be homogenous.\nAll levels were projected for the summer season.\n\nReferences:\n\nD.

While the measure is computed at the census tract (derived from 2014-2018 ACS estimates), these values are aggregated for a given Metropolitan Service Area (MSA). Thus, we have linked Interaction Indices for the MSA in which a participant may live, and not the census tract. The following contrasts were computed: Black vs. non-Hispanic white, Asian vs. non-Hispanic white, Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic white, nonwhite vs. non-Hispanic white.\nCode and source files used to derive these measures can be found here (Abad et al. 2023).\n\n\nGetis-Ord Gi* Statistics (ICPSR)\n le_l_gi\nMeasure description: From ICPSR Documentation:\nMeasures were calculated at the census tract level on the proportion of non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian and Pacific Islander for 1990 and 2000 census, and Hispanic persons per census tract. Gi* statistics are Z-scores that compare the proportion of the population in the focal tract and its neighboring tracts, to the average proportion of a larger geographic unit. For the majority of tracts, the larger geographic unit was the Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) these tracts belonged to, and for the minority of tracts that fell outside the boundaries of a CBSA, the County was used as the larger unit.\nData for the measures were obtained from the IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) data finder;  (2025b). Data were downloaded for the 1990 and 2000 census, and the 2006-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2019 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. Geographically standardized time series tables were used for 1990 and 2000 census data. All other ACS data were standardized to 2010 census tract boundaries.\nGi* statistics were calculated using both Rook and Queen conceptualization of spatial relationships. With Rook contiguity, neighbors are determined by those that share a common edge only, while Queen contiguity neighbors are those that share both an edge or a “corner” (common vertex). See detailed documentation for further details.\nCode and source files used to derive these measures can be found here (Abad et al. 2023).\n\n\nIndex of Concentration at the Extremes (ACS)\n le_l_eci\nMeasure description: Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) quantifies how persons in a specified area are concentrated into the top vs bottom of a specified societal distribution. We’ve linked two versions of the ICE: one in which we compare the top income quintile to lowest income quintile (income ICE) as a measure of economic segregation, and one in which we compare the top income quintile for non-Hispanic white to lowest income quintile of non-Hispanic Black individuals in a census tract (income + BW ICE) as a measure of racialized economic segregation.\nABCD Subdomain: Residential Segregation\nCode and source files used to derive these measures can be found here (Abad et al. 2023).\nReference: Krieger et al. (2018)\n\n\nMulti-group Entropy Index\n le_l_entropy\nMeasure description: Both the Index of Dissimilarity and Interaction Index can only measure the segregation of two groups compared to each other. The Multi-Group Entropy Index measures the spatial distribution of multiple groups simultaneously (see here). This measure is dependent on the number of categories included in the computation, and for the linked measures.\nThree measures are available as of this release: Multi-Group Entropy Scores at the census tract and metro-level, and a Multi-Group Entropy Index that standardizes the sum of the census-tract scores within a metro by the standard deviation of the metro-level distribution.\nCode and source files used to derive these measures can be found here (Abad et al. 2023).\nReference: Iceland (2004)",

IQVIA Xponent is based on a sample of approximately 49,900 retail (non-hospital) pharmacies, which dispense nearly 92% of all retail prescriptions in the United States. For this database, a prescription is a new or refill prescription dispensed at a retail pharmacy in the sample and paid for by commercial insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, cash or its equivalent, orother third-party coverage. This database does not include mail order prescriptions. For the calculation of dispensing rates, numerators are the projected total number of opioid prescriptions dispensed annually at the county level. Annual resident population denominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nOpioid prescriptions, including buprenorphine, codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, propoxyphene, tapentadol, and tramadol are included and identified using National Drug Codes. All prescriptions with days’ supply between 1 and 365 days and a known strength description are included. Cough and cold formulations containing opioids and buprenorphine products typically used to treat opioid use disorder are not included. In addition, methadone dispensed through methadone treatment programs is not included in the IQVIA Xponent data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nopioid_Rxper100K_0\nResidential history derived measure of opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100K in the county in which the respondent resides in year of baseline visit\n\n\nopioid_Rxper100K_1\nResidential history derived measure of opioid prescription dispensed per 100K in the county in which the respondent resides one year prior to baseline visit\n\n\nopioid_Rxper100K_2\nResidential history derived measure of opioid prescription dispensed per 100K in the county in which the respondent resides two years prior to baseline visit\n\n\nopioid_Rxper100K_3\nResidential history derived measure of opioid prescription dispensed per 100K in the county in which the respondent resides three years prior to baseline visit\n\n\nopioid_Rxper100K_4\nResidential history derived measure of opioid prescription dispensed per 100K in the county in which the respondent resides four years prior to baseline visit\n\n\nopioid_Rxper100K_5\nResidential history derived measure of opioid prescription dispensed per 100K in the county in which the respondent resides five years prior to baseline visit\n\n\n\nNotes and special considerations: In January 2019, IQVIA changed the frame of measurement in their projected prescription services from reflecting prescription demand to be “number of prescriptions dispensed to bin” to reflect total prescriptions actually “sold to the patient.” To do this, IQVIA eliminated the effects of voided and reversed prescriptions (prescriptions that were never received by the patient) beginning in 2017. This change in measurement frame resulted in a 1.9% downward shift in the measured opioid prescriptions dispensed. This enhancement was applied to data from 2017 and thereafter. Thus, caution should be exercised when examining trends during this time period. Furthermore, starting in 2019, prescriptions were based on the location of the prescriber, rather than the location of the pharmacy.\nReference: CDC (2024b)\n\n\nOPTIC-Vetted Co-prescribing Naloxone Policy Data (Optic)\n le_l_rxnalox\nMeasure description: Co-prescribing naloxone policies captured here represent state policies requiring physicians to co-prescribe naloxone with opioid and/or benzodiazepine prescriptions.

However, one amended the section and made those amendments retroactive to April 6, 2016. However, given no action could be taken on the retroactive date, we assume the PDAPS effective date of May 27,2016; thus, it is coded as June 2016.\nIn Jan 2008, California piloted naloxone programs in several counties (including the most populous LA and SF). However, this was not expanded statewide until January 2014. PDAPS uses the pilot date for the first law (2008), which is what we use here for “any NAL.” However, one could make the argument that the 2014 date is preferable.\nReferences:\n\nC. S.

These data were based on the following information:\n\nPDAPS (policy data last reported on June 1, 2017, but last downloaded by us and checked in September 19, 2019). These data were used primarily for the construction of (1) AnyPDMP_partial / date_AnyPDMP for new first-time PDMP laws passed after 1/1/1998; (2) electronic_partial / date_electronic; and (3) Must Access_partial / date_prescriber_mustaccess.\nUse of Brandeis University PDMP Training and Technical Assistance Center (TTAC) to obtain dates on first PDMP policy (including paper-based systems) that were adopted prior to January 1, 1998, (for AnyPDMP_partial / date_AnyPDMP).\nUse of Horwitz et al.

Mandatory use, which differs from mandatory registration, may simply mean that prescribers must have an account on the system; that they must input their patient’s information in the system, or that they must check the system before prescribing an opioid under different circumstances (see here). These are ultimately different levels of specificity of the law, and in the spirit of Horwitz et al. (2018), which encourages greater specificity in how these laws are defined. It is appropriate to use the term “physician must access” only when prescribers are mandated to access the database (regardless of the circumstance, which could differ if it is new patient, existing patient, and so on).\nReferences:\n\nHorwitz et al.

A subsample of hair samples is sent to a lab for analysis twice per year (not all hair is tested due to budgetary constraints). Initially 5% of a site’s population were requested annually for analysis based on a “high risk for substance use” algorithm. The algorithm is found here. Participants with a prior positive hair toxicology finding were included in the requested samples. Currently, samples from approximately 20% of participants at each site are analyzed . The pool of samples analyzed includes a proportion of randomly selected “low risk for substance use” participants. An additional 2% of ABCD participants’ samples are analyzed annually, including those who reported and did not report substance use. Additional analyses were made possible in Summer 2024, facilitating broad-based testing of hair samples collected during the 2-year, 4-year, 6-year, and 7-year follow-up visits, with all samples from those visits collected by July 1, 2024 tested. If a data user wants to include relative risk as a factor, as was calculated for samples prior to summer 2024, calculating a relative risk score may be more beneficial rather than relying on reason for selection.\nModifications since initial administration: ABCD has contracted with two hair testing labs: Psychemedics (2017-2023) and USDTL (2024-present). Procedures and processing steps are consistent between labs, except where specified below.\nFor completion of a full drug panel with screening and confirmation analysis, 100mg of the closest 3.9cm of hair to the scalp are needed. However, some collected samples do not have sufficient quantity to meet this threshold (quantity not sufficient, or QNS). In these instances, a testing order priority list, consistent with the aims of the ABCD Study, is implemented to the best ability of vendors. Cannabinoids are screened and tested first, followed by other drugs of interest (e.g., alcohol), with prescribed drugs (e.g., amphetamines) or drugs which are more commonly reported (e.g., nicotine) ranked as a lower priority for testing. Thus, all hair is used from every sample to meet the goals of the study. Drugs are first screened by immunoassay, with presumptive positives tested by LC-MS-MS or GC-MS-MS.\nFor hair tested by Psychemedics (2017-2023), there are two exceptions: THCCOOH and alcohol (EtG) analyses are directly tested by GS-MS-MS. For a brief period in fall 2022, approximately 600 EtG samples were directly tested by LC-MS-MS and, if positive, tested by GC-MS-MS, as this is the standard legal protocol. However, as there is often insufficient hair to run both analyses, only LC-MS-MS testing was done. The protocol was revised back to its original protocol of only testing EtG by GC-MS-MS. Because of this brief variation, separate variables are provided for EtG based on gas chromatography or liquid chromatography results.\nFor hair tested by USDTL (2024-present), several analytes have no immunoassay screen. For this reason, ETG is tested directly by LC-MS-MS, consistent with USDTL’s validated methods for assessing ETG. Parent cannabinoids (THC, CBD, delta-8-THC, and delta-10-THC) are only tested if the immunoassay screen for THCCOOH is positive.\nHair color, length, and cosmetical treatment (e.g., flat iron; perm) is documented starting at the 2-year follow-up of ABCD data collection. USDTL also provides exact weight and length of samples they tested, which is provided within the data release.\nNotes and special considerations: Hair samples were not collected for remote visits. This affected participants in the latter part of the 2-year follow-up, the middle of the 3-year follow-up, and a small proportion of early 4-year follow-up assessments. All hair testing was conducted by Psychemedics Corporation until 2024; beginning in 2024, USDTL was contracted to test all samples.\nHair testing methods were selected with the help of the toxicology vendors to optimally meet the goals of the ABCD Study. Importantly, given the young age of participants and their nascent substance use, all hair samples are tested in the maximally sensitive method offered by each vendor.\nFor Psychemedics, samples were tested at the level of detection/quantification (LOD/LOQ) to maximize sensitivity in identifying youth substance use. Following screening, Psychemedics used an extensive hair wash protocol to mitigate against external contamination. Each positive sample was reviewed by an expert at Psychemedics to compare quantified results to a sample-based standard, through an algorithm determined by the wash contents, which indicates that a positive determination is above what could be expected from external contamination. Thus, while an LOD/LOQ is set as a threshold, a sample may be labeled as “Negative” if the expert determined the quantified value is not substantially different enough from wash contents, indicating potential for external contamination (Morris-Kukoski, Montgomery, & Hammer, 2014; Hill et al., 2005). Psychemedics tests the following drug classes: cocaine, opioids, phencyclidine, amphetamines, cannabinoids, alcohol, nicotine, fentanyl, and benzodiazepines. Metabolites are tested, as possible, to confirm personal consumption of the drug. These combined processes maximize sensitivity through low LOD/LOQ with extended wash using a wash criterion and considering specific drug analytes to mitigate against general hair testing concerns (e.g., potential external contamination; potential melanin-based binding for some drugs).\nFor USDTL, hair samples first were screened using an ELISA immunoassay screen. The limit of detection (LOD) for ELISA screening was set using negative controls and was established in each batch of tested samples. This established a highly sensitive threshold to rule out negative hair samples, with any potential positive samples sent for gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry confirmation testing. Prior to confirmation testing, samples underwent a wash protocol to remove potential environmental contamination. USDTL tests for markers of the following drug classes: cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, amphetamines, cannabinoids, ethyl glucuronide (long term ethanol biomarker), nicotine, and fentanyl.\nCut-offs for USDTL testing can be seen in the table below. Analytes are marked as positive if they are above the limit of quantification (LOQ); however, values at or above the limit of detection (LOD) may be reported. As noted on the Confirmation MS Cutoff Table, use of LOQ is below the routine cutoff employed in many forensic cases in order to maximize sensitivity due to the relatively young age of our population.\nFinally, to optimally use hair samples, a testing priority list was given to each vendor.

    "text": "Interview & Timeline Followback\n\nSubstance Use Interview\n su_y_sui  score documentation\nMeasure description: Data from this module will provide information in the following domains:\nBaseline:\n\nLifetime patterns of substance use (including total dose in standard units, maximum dose, first use, first regular use) of all major drug categories (alcohol, nicotine [cigarettes, ENDS, smokeless tobacco, cigars, hookah, pipe, nicotine replacement], marijuana [smoked flower, blunts, vaped flower, edibles, vaped concentrates, smoked concentrates, THC-infused alcohol, tinctures, synthetic THC], CBD, other vaped products, cocaine, cathinones, methamphetamine, ecstasy/MDMA, ketamine, GHB, heroin, hallucinogens [others], salvia, psilocybin, steroids, inhalants, prescription depressants/sedatives, prescription opioids, OTC, others & a drop-down menu capturing rare substances of abuse [e.g., kava, kratom]).\nLow-level use of alcohol, nicotine, cannabis\nCaffeine use in past 6-months\nTimeline Followback (TLFB) in past 6-months was collected to measure patterns of use in youth who reported use.\n\nFollow-up (Longitudinal) Sessions:\n\nYes/no information about whether they used and whether this was their first use (first use yes/no, age of first use) for each drug category since their last yearly session was collected (i.e., not including mid-year interview).\nLow-level use (alcohol, nicotine, cannabis) questionnaires were administered in those who reported use.\nCaffeine use in the past month.\nFor youth who reported using a substance, the Timeline Followback (TLFB) interview measured detailed patterns of use for each substance category since last session. Starting in year 2 follow-up the TLFB covered “detailed” (past 12 months) and “estimated” (&gt;12 months). Detailed period includes detailed interview covering standard units per occasion across each week of the year; therefore, total dose, maximum dose, average doses on use days, weekday vs. weekend use summary variables are available. Estimated periods collect average use for the month; therefore, only “total dose in standard units” is available for summary outcomes.\nNote: Substance use (see su_y_sui) and patterns are measured in SU Patterns and on the TLFB Calendar (su_y_tlfb); in addition, many youth complete the brief mid-year interview (see su_y_mypi). This data could be combined with SU Patterns (yes/no use data) and quantity/frequency TLFB patterns data if scientists want to include all possible SU measurement modes over time.\n\nLifetime Patterns & Follow-up Questions (Baseline): Assessment of when a participant first used a drug, first regular (weekly) use, lifetime quantity (in standard doses), maximum dose (standard), last date of use. Follow-up questions about cigarettes, ENDS, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine are also given to assess for issues related to mode of use, route of administration, and flavoring.\nSU Interview (Recent Use Patterns & Follow-up Questions): At follow-up sessions, measures of when a participant used each drug and whether this was their first use (yes/no, and date of first use). Follow-up questions about cigarettes, ENDS, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine are also given to assess for issues related to mode of use, typical dosage, route of administration, and flavoring.\nAlcohol Low Level Use (iSip): If youth reported alcohol sipping, nine questions assess participants’ earliest sipping experience (including when, context, what type of alcohol) and whether or not a full drink was consumed (items adapted from a survey developed by Kristina M. Jackson et al. (2015)). Youth only fill out the follow-up questions (beyond number of sips) for their first sipping occasion.\nNicotine Low Level Use: If youth reported using cigarette, ENDS, or smokeless tobacco product, ten questions assess first low-level experiences with nicotine products including type of nicotine product, first puff of a combustible cigarette or ENDS, first use of smokeless tobacco, where and when this occurred, and whether it led to further use (adapted from alcohol sipping measure). Youth only fill out the follow-up questions (beyond number of puffs) for their first use occasion.\nCannabis Low Level Use: If youth reported using cannabis product, eight questions were given to assess first low-level experiences with cannabis products including initial experiences with cannabis (first puff or taste of marijuana), where they obtained the substance, when these experiences occurred, whether it led to further use and subjective experience of feeling “high” (adapted from alcohol sipping measure). Youth only fill out the follow-up questions (beyond number of puffs/tastes) for their first use occasion.\nCaffeine Intake: All youth receive this measure to quantify frequency and quantity of various caffeine beverage use (time period: past 6 months at the baseline administration or past month in follow-up sessions).\nParticipants were asked how much of a standard unit of caffeine (coffee (8oz); espresso drinks (1 shot espresso); caffeinated tea (8 oz); soda with caffeine (12oz), and energy drinks (8oz) consumed in an average week. Trained RAs recorded average caffeine consumption across modalities and calculated consumption according to the above units.\nModifications since initial administration:\nVaping changes: Due to the significant rise in vaping behaviors in youth, we made changes to separately measure vaping versus smoking marijuana (MJ) flower and concentrate at all follow-up points administered after 6/24/20.\nChanges to the SU Interview & Timeline Follow Back (TLFB):\n\nAt the time of the vaping changes, all baseline assessments were completed. Thus, a variable indicating vaped MJ flower su_y_sui__use__mj__vape_001__l was added, but coded as zero if the youth reported no MJ puffing/tasting (su_y_sui__use__mj__puff_001 = 0), if they did report puffing/trying MJ flower, then su_tlfb_vape_mj_fl_use is reported as missing at baseline. Similarly, a variable reflecting vaped MJ concentrate su_y_sui__use__mj__conc__vape_001__l was added, although no youth reported using concentrate at baseline.\nAt time-points after 6/24/20: We separately measured vaping versus smoking marijuana (MJ) flower and concentrate (su_y_sui__use__mj__smoke_001__l measures smoking MJ flower while su_y_sui__use__mj__vape_001__l measures vaping MJ flower; su_y_sui__use__mj__conc__smoke_001__l measures smoking MJ concentrate while su_y_sui__use__mj__conc__vape_001__l measures vaping MJ concentrate).\nSimilar changes were made to measure whether this was the youth’s first use of these products:\n\nsu_y_sui__mj__smoke__onset_001\nsu_y_sui__mj__vape__onset_001\nsu_y_sui__mj__conc__vape__onset_001\nsu_y_sui__mj__conc__smoke__onset_001\n\nVaping/smoking MJ flower and concentrate were noted on the TLFB gating variable (su_y_sui__branch__use_001__l___1) and measured on TLFB calendar (see Timeline Followback below). In some cases, data on route of administration for MJ flower (su_y_sui__mj__fwup_001) was missing, when that occurred smoked MJ flower data remained the same and vaped MJ flower was coded missing. We dropped vaping from route of administration question for smoking MJ concentrate and re-coded into su_y_sui__mj__conc__fwup_002__l.\nFor participants who completed the SU interview prior to 6/24/20, their answers were re-coded based on their response to original follow-up questions measuring route of administration indicating they typically smoked or vaped their flower or concentrate, and mapped onto the new variables outlined above. Options for cannabinoid content of MJ edibles were also re-coded to exclude the CBD-only option (su_y_sui__mj__edbl__fwup_001). We also added a gating question about whether they vaped anything (gating to new vaping expectancies or motives questionnaires; su_y_sui__branch__ud__vape_001__l).\n\nChanges to Low Level MJ Use Questionnaire: - The low-level MJ use variable denoting product type (su_y_lowuse__mj_006) was re-coded onto the same scale used for follow-up, which included vaped/smoked MJ flower and oil; however, route of administration was not known for MJ flower at that time point, so those responses were kept as smoked flower (coded items 1-2).\n\nWe added vaping wording to instructions and separated out vaping versus smoking MJ flower and concentrate as options for their first experience (su_y_lowuse__mj_006__v01); this was re-coded based on route of administration responses, in the cases where route of administration was not available, smoked MJ flower remained coded the same (options 1-2). Additional options for who the MJ belonged to were also added (su_y_lowuse__mj_002; options 13-18).\n\nAdditional changes to the Substance Use Interview:\n\nStarting 9/1/2023, extensive gating was added to the substance use interview and TLFB to address discordant data between the two instruments; participants that endorsed substance use on the substance use interview were required to respond to the TLFB to help match data between the two instruments.\nStarting 9/1/2023, low level use was changed from a free text box to a dropdown to prevent erroneous typing errors. This meant that a maximum limit of 1,000 uses was placed on low-level variables. While this encompasses almost all participant cases up to this time point, RAs were encouraged to enter new cases that exceed 1,000 at the 1,000 sip/puff limit.\nStarting 9/1/2023, an additional gating question to age of first use was removed as participants were endorsing new use, but saying no to this particular question that affirmed they had started new use. Now, gating has been modified so that all participants that endorse new use will be automatically asked the age of first use question.\nTo improve administration time and accuracy, a caffeine calculator was added for each modality beginning in September 2023 where participants could record the size of drink, the number of servings, and the frequency with which they had each drink (daily, weekly, or monthly). The new calculator allowed for multiple entries within each modality (e.g., three separate coffee entries, two separate energy entries) to allow for the various consumption of caffeinated drinks across the past month. After entering in caffeine consumption, overall caffeine totals for each modality were converted to the original standard units to facilitate longitudinal consistency.\nStarting 3/15/2024, a new response option was added to the smokeless tobacco follow up questions to include Zyn’s as a potential response option.\n\nReferences:\n\nLisdahl et al.

(2022).\n\n\nTimeline Followback Interview\n su_y_tlfb  score documentation\nMeasure description:\nBaseline:\n\nThe web-based Timeline Followback (TLFB) interview method is used to obtain specific quantitative estimates of drug use over a period of time using memory cues and a calendar format (Sobell & Sobell, 1996). Detailed patterns over the past 6 months were measured for youth who reported using a substance.\n\nFollow-up (Longitudinal) sessions:\n\nThe web-based TLFB calendar interview was used to measure “detailed” patterns of use (past 12 months from their most recent annual visit) and “estimated” (est) patterns of use for remaining months since the youth’s last session for each substance category (in standard units; see above for list). Due to variability in length between sessions, each youth will have a different period the TLFB covers.\nDetailed TLFB interview methods go through the 12 month calendar week by week and yield summary variables that include total standard dose, total days substance used, max dose (in standard units in a single day), average standard doses on use days, total standard doses on weekend, total standard doses on weekdays, and last date of use. It is recommended that scientists primarily utilize the detailed TLFB data when examining dose-dependent relationships, as reliability and validity data for the TLFB generally does not go beyond a 12-month period. For 6.0 data release, 3-month and 1-month data is also available; this may be most closely linked in time with other endophenotype data.\nThe estimated TLFB period is based on their average monthly pattern and summary variables for each substance include total standard doses.\nCumulative TLFB variables (cum) for total dose are calculated across the detailed and estimated (est) variables for total standard dose for each drug category.\nUse of estimated and cumulative data is to account for cumulative effects and to ensure proper grouping of use (i.e., full cumulative use between sessions, and lifetime use); due to time constraints and reliability concerns, detailed dose per occasion, co-use days, max dose, and average dose per occasion were not measured so this remote substance use pattern data is more limited.\nThere is a grand summary variable, su_y_tlfb_ud that denotes the number of events per day across all substances pooled together. Users are not encouraged to use this, unless a very raw summary variable reflecting any substance use is needed as a covariate.\nThe raw data includes only participants/events for whom a TLFB interview was conducted. The summary score variables are included with 0’s added to replace blank responses for non-use.\nCombined cannabis and nicotine use day variables across all modes of use are calculated for the detailed period, summing any modes of cannabis or nicotine use days together into singular variables ( see nicotine combined use days tlfb_cal_scr_nic_comb_ud and cannabis combined use days tlfb_cal_scr_mj_mj_comb_ud). These are suggested variables to be used for primary analyses examining dose-dependent impact of combined nicotine or cannabis products (due to the difficulty of converting standard doses across modes of use).\nAlternative variables are available that utilize an estimated converted total standard dose across nicotine and cannabis products for the detailed period (tlfb_cal_scr_nic_comb_td, tlfb_cal_scr_mj_comb_td), estimated period (tlfb_cal_scr_nic_comb_td_est, tlfb_cal_scr_mj_comb_td_est), and cumulative (detailed+estimated) periods (tlfb_cal_scr_nic_comb_td_cum, tlfb_cal_scr_mj_comb_td_cum).\nThese variables utilize the “Standard dose conversions: Nicotine & cannabis products” outlined below. Users should be aware of the converted standard doses utilized and may choose to develop their own conversion, or to examine each nicotine or cannabis use product separately in analyses.\nCo-use days (marijuana+alcohol, marijuana+nicotine, nicotine+alcohol) were calculated (days where the participant reported use of both substances) for the detailed period. NOTE: this does not measure simultaneous use, but rather if the substances were used on the same day.\nNote: 2023 TLFB Program Update: A new version of the web-based TLFB application was developed and has been used for all assessments starting 9/2023. The new version which was developed using the R Shiny framework more effectively and automatically links the substance use reporting between the REDCap-based Substance Use Interview and the TLFB interview. This allows for better consistency of substance use reports and fixed “bugs” related to repeated events and miscategorization of estimated period (see notes below). The overall TLFB interview methods, substances covered, and standard units remained the same. This new version of the TLFB application also adjusted estimated measurement options (times greater than 12 months since the participants last annual visit) so that estimated use is now entered as “estimated daily,” “estimated weekly,” and “estimated monthly” use; this allows for an approximated number of total standard doses to be created per a substance for each estimated month and is harmonized with the older TLFB version in the summary scores for all estimated periods.\n\nStandard dose conversions: Nicotine & Cannabis products: NDA 6.0 data release\nNicotine products:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nOriginal standard dose\nConverted standard unit algorithm\nSee rationale below\n\n\n\n\nCigarette\n1 cigarette\ntlfb_cal_scr_cig_td\n1\n\n\nENDS\n1 occasion\ntlfb_cal_scr_ecig_td\n3\n\n\nCigar\n1 cigar\ntlfb_cal_scr_cg_td * (14)\n1\n\n\nHookah\n1 occasion\ntlfb_cal_scr_hooka_td\n3\n\n\nPipe tobacco use\n1 occasion\ntlfb_cal_scr_pipe_td\n3\n\n\nNicotine replacement\n1 occasion\ntlfb_cal_scr_nicrx_td\n3\n\n\nSmokeless tobacco\n1 pinch/pouch\ntlfb_cal_scr_chew_td * (4)\n2\n\n\n\nRationale: Actual nicotine and THC/cannabinoid content may vary across modes of use; scientists are advised to use their best judgment as to whether they want to utilize this combined converted standard dose data (across modes). All users are warned that exact nicotine or THC content is not known and actual content may vary greatly, even within specific product types or modes of use. Attempts were made to standardize across modes of use to approximate “occasions” of use (distinct periods where the youth had a full use of the substance and then took a break that lasted at least 15 minutes).\n\nCigars converted to estimated equivalent cigarette tobacco content (approx. 1 gram in cigarette, 14 grams in cigars; note, cigarillos already converted 5=1 cigar). Thus, 1 cigar standard unit was converted to 4 “converted standard units” to align with cigarettes. CDC (2025) and  (2005).\n\n\n1 cigar contains ½ oz of tobacco (~14 grams)\nCigarettes contain &lt;1 gram tobacco\nCigarillos (3-4 inches) have approx 3 grams tobacco\nCigarillos contain 3 grams of nicotine\n\n\nSmokeless tobacco approximate conversion of nicotine content, 1 pinch/pouch for 30 minutes = 4 cigarettes (several smokeless tobacco fact sheets), thus 1 pinch/pouch was converted to 4 “standard units” to align with cigarettes.\n1 cigarette, and estimated equivalent cigars/smokeless tobacco, was considered equivalent to 1 “occasion” of ENDS, hookah, pipe tobacco, nicotine replacement. Based on youth self-report of “occasion” as a period they used the drug, then took a break (at least 15 minutes).\n\nCannabis products:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nOriginal standard dose\nConverted standard unit algorithm\nSee rationale below\n\n\n\n\nSmoked MJ flower\ngrams\ntlfb_cal_scr_smj_td * (0.5)\n1\n\n\nVaped MJ flower\ngrams\ntlfb_cal_scr_vmjf_td * (0.5)\n1\n\n\nMJ Blunts\ngrams\ntlfb_cal_scr_blunts_td * (0.5)\n1\n\n\nMJ Edibles\noccasions\ntlfb_cal_scr_emj_td\n2\n\n\nSmoked MJ Oil/Concentrate\noccasions\ntlfb_cal_scr_dab_td\n2\n\n\nVaped MJ Oil/Concentrate\noccasions\ntlfb_cal_scr_vmjo_td\n2\n\n\nMJ-infused alcohol\nstandard drinks\ntlfb_cal_scr_mjalc_td\n2\n\n\nMJ tinctures\n1 ml\ntlfb_cal_scr_mjt_td\n2\n\n\nSynthetic MJ\ngrams\ntlfb_cal_scr_k2_td * (0.5)\n1\n\n\n\nRationale: Actual THC/cannabinoid content may vary across modes of use; scientists are advised to use their best judgment as to whether they want to utilize this combined converted standard dose data (across modes). All users are warned that exact THC or other cannabinoid content is not known and actual content may vary greatly, even within specific product types or modes of use. Attempts were made to standardize across modes of use to approximate “occasions” of use for some modes (distinct periods where the youth had a full use of the substance and then took a break).\n\nSmoked/vaped cannabis flower, blunts and synthetic marijuana/cannabis were measured in grams; average size of 1 joint set at 0.5 grams; RA-assisted TLFB converted bowls, pipes, to grams with “average” joint set at 0.5 grams. This (0.5 grams) is taken as an estimated equivalent converted standard unit to compare with “occasions” for other modes of use.\nOther modes of use are measured in “occasions”; “occasion” as a period they used the drug until desired effect, then took a break (at least 15 minutes).\n\nNotes and special considerations:\n\nAs noted above, due to a significant rise in vaping behaviors in youth in 2020, we made changes to separately measure vaping versus smoking marijuana (MJ) flower and concentrate/oil at all follow-up points administered after 6/24/20. We added vaped MJ flower (su_y_tlfb__mj__vape__flwr_totdose) and vaped MJ oil (su_y_tlfb__mj__vape__oil_totdose) variables.\nIf the SU interview and TLFB calendar were administered prior to these changes, responses were re-coded whenever possible to separately reflect vaping vs. smoking MJ flower or oil based on route of administration responses at that time-point (su_y_sui__mj__fwup_001, su_y_sui__mj__conc__fwup_002__l); if this information was missing, then their answers remained coded as smoked flower or smoked concentrate.\n\nPrior releases of TLFB data ought to be replaced with this release, as errors in prior releases were fixed in the 5.0 and 6.0 releases.\nNote: 2023 TLFB Program Update: A new version of the web-based TLFB application was developed and has been used for all assessments starting 9/2023. This new version fixes the below “bugs” and improves continuity between the REDCap SU Interview and TLFB modules.\n\n6.0 data release correction: Some youth’s report of cannabis was not scored on the TLFB in prior releases due to variable labeling error between the individual raw data files and calculated score algorithm that was discovered and fixed for the 5.0 and 6.0 data release\n6.0 data release corrected an error discovered (12/22) where repeated substance use events on the TLFB were only recorded once in the individual day-level data files utilized for the calendar scoring; this was corrected in the day-level and calculated data for all waves.\n6.0 data release: Prior sessions that were measured in mg for edibles or MJ concentrates were converted to occasions for consistency across data waves.\n6.0 data release: There is missing TLFB data for some youth participants; some is due to COVID-19 related administration in the home and privacy concerns (see “Xskipout_session” for SU interview completion details if they underwent a virtual or hybrid research session); others are missing due to research assistant (RA) error (i.e., youth reported using a drug, but RA did not launch TLFB to measure detailed dose/patterns).\n6.0 data release: some youth have 0’s in their individual TLFB summary data, this occurred rarely if an RA launched the TLFB, put in an initial date of use but did not record any standard units (denoted as N/A in day-level data; this occurred rarely when a youth initially reported using, but then denied use).\n6.0 data release: In the original TLFB application (prior to Sept 1, 2023), errors were noted counting some estimated periods as detailed periods; this was fixed in the current release and any data collected &gt;12 months from SU interview were coded as estimated period.\n6.0 data release: Maximum daily standard unit dose limits were instituted on the TLFB across all waves to date to reduce outlier events:\nMax limit=96: alcohol (alc), cigarette (cig), ENDS (nic__vape), smokeless tobacco (chew), cigar (nic__cigar), hookah (nic__hookah), pipes (pipe), nicotine rx replacements (nic__rplc), cigars, MJ smoked flower (mj__smoke), MJ vaped flower (mj__vape), blunts (blunt), MJ edibles (mj__edbl), smoked MJ oil (mj__conc), vaped MJ oil (mj__conc__vape), MJ alcohol drink (mj__drink), MJ tincture (mj__tinc), CBD (cbd), synthetic MJ (mj__synth), inhalants, other (othdrg).\nMax limit=24: cocaine (coc), cathinones (cath), methamphetamine (meth), MDMA (mdma), ketamine (ket), GHB (ghb), opiates/heroin (opi), hallucinogens (hall), psilocybin (shroom), salvia (salvia), steroids (roid), stimulant rx (rxsed), sedative rx (rxsed), opiate rx (rxopi), OTC (dxm) .\nNote: Inhalants were initially capped at 24, but extended to a max of 96 on 7/16/24.\n\nReferences:\n\nCDC (2025)\n (2005)\nLisdahl et al.

This change allows for more precise temporal alignment. Additionally, based on these variables, we provide table-specific age variables {table_name}_age to enhance age-related analyses (see here for more details).",

    "text": "Summary scores\nIn an effort to correct errors, improve algorithms based on advancements in the relevant fields, increase consistency across measures and domains, and enhance transparency for users, all summary scores computed by the DAIRC2 were re-developed for the 6.0 release. This includes both previously released summary scores and new scores developed since the last release.\nThe code to compute the various scores has been published as an R package called ABCDscores on GitHub and is accompanied by a documentation website. The goal of making the package public is to support transparency and reproducibility of ABCD release data by providing the exact algorithms and code used to compute the released summary scores. This allows users to tie a specific data release version to the corresponding version of the codebase (see also here for the rationale behind creating this R package).\nThe re-development aimed to implement consistent standards across domains. For example, a maximum of 20% missing ingoing items was established, and wherever possible, (prorated) sums were replaced with means. Additionally, variables reporting the total number of items in a score were removed, as they represent redundant information that does not vary between participants.\nDue to the significant changes made to many summary scores included in previous releases, we did not maintain the mapping between current and legacy variable names (see here). This decision was made to indicate to users who may have used those variables in previous analyses that the contents may differ significantly in the 6.0 dataset. Direct comparisons should only be made after consulting ABCDscores and the accompanying documentation to understand the new algorithms.",

    "text": "Other general data changes\nDuring the recuration process, we made several general changes to the data structure and content to improve usability and consistency across the dataset. These changes include:\n\nIn previous releases, variables that captured the same concept were sometimes named differently across different events. To reduce redundancy and confusion, these variables have been collapsed into a single variable.\nPreviously, all variables were associated with a longitudinal event. Static variables (such as race, ethnicity, genetic PCs, etc.) were typically linked to the baseline event. In the 6.0 release, static variables are now provided in static data tables—tables that do not include the session/event column session_id (see here for more details on the identifier columns). This change facilitates easier linking of static variables to the longitudinal data tables.",

    "section": "ABCD (General)",
    "text": "ABCD (General)\n\nStandard variables tables\nThe 6.0 release includes two new tables that contain important variables likely to be of interest for a wide range of analyses. These tables include static variables (ab_g_stc) and dynamic/longitudinal variables (ab_g_dyn) that are not specific to any particular domain. Examples of these variables include visit-level information, design/nesting variables, and variables useful for describing the cohort.\n\n\nSchool and district IDs\nFor the 6.0 release, school and district IDs were amended due to the following changes. Please note that these changes are specific to the pseudo school ID ab_g_dyn__design_id__district and ab_g_dyn__design_id__school and do not impact the linked SEDA data:\n\nAdditional data were recovered from earlier data collection interfaces. These data were used to recalculate available data as prior data releases had applied a filter restricting inclusion to cases with &gt;= 10 pseudo IDs.\nPrivate schools without an NCES ID were inaccurately assigned an anonymized district ID. These district IDs were removed for the 6.0 release.\nIn prior releases, when an informant reported that a participant was homeschooled, school_id was recoded to ‘0.’ However, in the 6.0 release, participants who were homeschooled were not given a ab_g_dyn__design_id__school/ab_g_dyn__design_id__district unless their homeschooling was associated with an NCES school/district identification number.\n\n\n\nFamily and birth IDs\nIn the 6.0 release, we corrected a small number of errors in the ab_g_stc__design_id__fam and ab_g_stc__design_id__birth variables to more accurately reflect sibling relationships between participants. Please disregard data from the rel_family_id and rel_birth_id variables in prior releases in favor of the 6.0 release data.\n\n\nSite ID\nIn the 6.0 release, we corrected a small number of errors in the site ID variable, ab_g_dyn__design_site. Please disregard information about sites in prior releases in favor of the 6.0 release data. The site ID is now provided as a categorical variable that lists the site names (e.g., \"1\"=‘Children’s Hospital Los Angeles’) instead of a coded variable (e.g., \"site01\").\n\n\nEthno-racial identity\nSeveral new ethno-racial identity summary score variables are available in the data release, capturing ethnicity and race based on baseline and longitudinal responses from youth and parents:\n\nab_g_stc__cohort_ethn: Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic classification\n\nab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__leg: 6-level legacy classification prioritizing Hispanic ethnicity\n\nab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__mblack: 8-level classification highlighting Black identity in multiracial endorsements\n\nab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__mhisp: 8-level classification highlighting Hispanic identity in multiracial endorsements\n\nab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__meim: 15-level classification based on MEIM responses\n\nab_g_stc__cohort_race__nih: 7-level classification based on NIH standards\n\nSome of these variables are newly introduced in Release 6.0. More detail on how they are computed is available in the ABCDscores package.\n\n\nHousehold income\nA new household income variable (ab_g_dyn__cohort_income__hhold__3lvl) was created with three distinct levels (as well as \"999\"=‘Do not know’ and \"777\"=‘Decline to answer’):\n\n&lt;$50,000\n$50,000 to &lt;$100,000\n&gt;=$100,000\n\nThis variable was developed to offer a convenient categorization of household income, reflecting a common practice among researchers using ABCD data. The selection of cut-offs for each income level was informed by an analysis of alternative categorization methods and a careful examination of cell sizes across all study time points. The goal was to ensure sufficient representation within each level while maintaining the meaningfulness of the income brackets.\nThis new variable is intended to facilitate ease of use in analysis, particularly for studies where more granular detail is not required. However, more detailed versions of the household income variable also remain available in the dataset (e.g. a variable with 5 levels, ab_g_dyn__cohort_income__hhold__5lvl).\n\n\nAnonymized Date of Birth\nWe changed the algorithm for how anonymized birthdates are computed in the 6.0 release. In previous releases, the algorithm always used the 15th day of the month in which a participant was born (for example, if a participant was born on April 18th, 2010, their anonymized birthdate was set to April 15th, 2010).\nIn the new algorithm, we first determine whether a participant’s birthday falls in the first half (1st–15th) or second half (16th–end) of the month. Then, for each birthday, we randomly select a new day within the same half of the month.",

However, we were unable to complete this process for the item-level KSADS data. As a result, the 6.0 release does not include individual items, but these will be included in a future release.\nAdditionally, the symptoms and diagnoses have been moved from a ‘summary scores’ table into their respective module’s table.\n\nKSADS eating disorders\nThe Mental Health Workgroup did an extensive review of the criteria used for all previously released eating disorder diagnoses in KSADS. The group agreed that the criterion were more restrictive than necessary, and thus underestimated the rates of eating disorder diagnoses. Thus, they determined these diagnoses should be removed from the 6.0 release and recommend users should create their own diagnoses summary scores using the symptom data.\nIn the meantime, the Mental Health Workgroup is working with KSADS to create more accurate diagnoses, which we hope to include in the 7.0 data release.\n\n\nKSADS-COMP Updates to 2.0\nThere was a diagnostic algorithm error detected in 2023 (update pending 7.0):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnoses\nModifications Required\n\n\nOppositional Defiant Disorder\nCurrent disorder had allowed for presence of current or past symptoms – current diagnosis will be updated such that only current symptoms can be counted toward current diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife Events (PhenX)\nIn order to account for changes over time to the Life Events (PhenX) measures it was necessary to develop muliple versions of summary scores.

See su_y_tlfb_adm for SU interview completion details, and variables starting with su_y_tlfb_adm__rmt for details on remote visits.\nSome youth have 0’s in their individual TLFB summary data, this occurred rarely if an RA launched the TLFB, put in an initial date of use but did not record any standard units (denoted as N/A in day-level data; this occurred rarely when a youth initially reported using, but then denied use). This issue issue is corrected with the new TLFB app.\nWe discovered an error in the formula used to calculate all “3-month use days” variables (suffix _3mo_ud).

To learn more, see the ABCC documentation.\n\n\nTask-based fMRI\n\nEvent timing offset for GE scanners\nThere was previously a discrepancy in how stimulus times were modeled relative to the end of the calibration/dummy volumes in the image acquisition that affects GE scanners. The issue is related to how the E-prime tasks were programmed for GE scanners that resulted in an unexpected timing offset of 800 msec or less.\nWe modified our code for extracting event timing information from ABCD E-prime files (https://github.com/ABCD-STUDY/abcd_extract_eprime.git). Rather than rely on the first fixation event (e.g., CueFix.OnsetTime) the modified code now uses the timing data from the initial and or final trigger events (e.g., GetReady.RTTime) to determine the reference time that represents the start of the first non-dummy image volume. We also modified the number of initial volumes discarded prior to task fMRI time series analysis for GE scanners, with 4 volumes removed for GE DV26 and 15 volumes removed for GE DV26 and later.\n\n\nE-Prime timing errors for GE scanners\nIn a relatively small, though substantial, subset of task fMRI acquisitions collected on GE scanners (~9% of runs), the time between the 1st and 16th trigger pulse sent from the scanner does not match the expected 12 seconds.\nWe modified our task fMRI analysis pipeline to calculate trigger pulse timing discrepancies to identify E-prime runs for which the delay between the first trigger pulse and last recorded trigger pulse does not match the expectation (12 seconds for GE scanners). In cases where the discrepancy was either 0.8, 1.6, or 2.4 seconds (or within 0.01 seconds of those values), indicating missed (undetected) trigger pulses (~3% of runs), we adjusted the start time (used as the reference for subsequent events) by subtracting the discrepancy. We further modified the task fMRI analysis pipeline to exclude from processing any other runs that had a start time discrepancy (absolute difference from expectation relative to initial trigger pulse) larger than 0.5 seconds (~6% of runs), as such cases reflect irregular trigger timing and make it difficult or impossible to be sure when the stimulus run started relative to the imaging scan. For imaging visits with no valid task fMRI runs due to timing discrepancies, no derived results will be produced, and the imaging inclusion flags for the corresponding task will be set to 0. See Data Documentation.\nWe also sought to identify runs for which the delay between the start of the run and the onset of the first fixation does not match the expectation (500 msec for 1st nBack run on GE scanners, 0 msec otherwise). Runs with an onset time delay greater than 5 seconds were excluded from processing. Smaller discrepancies (i.e., up to 5 seconds) were allowed for this type of delay, because they do not introduce an error in the time series analysis, like an unknown delay between the start of the scan and the start of the run would. Instead, there is merely a shift in the timing of events relative to the start of the run, which can be correctly modeled.\n\n\n\nColumn misnaming in rsfMRI network to subcortical ROI correlation tabulated data\nThe column names in the table mr_y_rsfmri__corr__gpnet__aseg, which contains the tabulated imaging data for rsfMRI correlations between networks and subcortical ROIs, were corrected in the current release. In previous releases, columns were systematically misnamed. That is, the ordering of the column names did not match the ordering of the values of the columns. This problem was caused by swapping the inner and outer loops when iterating over networks and subcortical ROIs while constructing the column names. For example, to correctly match the data, instead of all ROIs for the first network having been listed first, all networks for the first ROI should have been listed first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable providing mapping between wrong and corrected names\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below provides the mapping between column names included in the 6.0 release with the incorrect column names that were included in the 5.1 and prior releases, along with the correct column names that should have been used previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n rsfmri_gpnet_aseg_correction.csv",

Since multiple follow up questions are displayed for each “gating” question, the follow up questions being presented out of order resulted in response variables being out of order in the dataset and potentially making it unclear to parents which events they were answering follow up questions about.\nWe therefore excluded any of these follow up items from the release data, creating some missingness in the dataset where an individual may have responded “yes” to the gating question, but have no follow up responses. The specific follow up variables affected and excluded are listed below:\n\nsdev_p_vict_018__l\nsdev_p_vict_019__l\nsdev_p_vict_020__l\nsdev_p_vict_021__l\nsdev_p_vict_022__l\nsdev_p_vict_023__l\nsdev_p_vict_024__l\nsdev_p_vict_025__l\nsdev_p_vict_026__l\nsdev_p_vict_027__l\n\nPlease contact ABCD-SD with any questions about this issue or other data analysis suggestions: PI Lia Ahonen ahonenl@upmc.edu",

    "text": "Data access\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I access the data?\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data are publicly shared with eligible researchers with a valid research use of the data at a research institution. Please visit How to Access Data or the NBDC datahub for more information on how to access and download the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m from a non-US institution - can I access the data?\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data are publicly shared with eligible researchers with a valid research use of the data, and who are at an institution with an active Federal Wide Assurance, which many international institutions have (https://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/fwasearch.aspx?styp=bsc). Users from many other countries have successfully accessed and published with the ABCD Study data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a cost to access the data?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no cost to access the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I have a student or trainee on my DUC? I’m a student, can I have my own DUC?\n\n\n\n\n\nLead investigators may obtain their own DUC, but trainees and students must be part of an investigator-led group DUC. A lead investigator (PI) may submit a single DUC that includes trainees, lab members, and other collaborators at their institution (adding or removing users is managed via user dashboard). The lead investigator is responsible for ensuring that individuals added as part of a group-level DUC are in compliance with its terms and conditions. Note that it is essential for the primary DUC holder to renew annually, as expiration will result in access being revoked for all listed collaborators.\nLearn more on the NBDC Datahub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need IRB approval to use these data?\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitutions vary on whether they consider use of the de-identified dataset to be human subjects research, with some requiring expedited-style or even exempt IRB reviews by their institution’s IRB. Other institutions do not consider it to be human subjects research given the de-identified nature of the data. That is a question to ask your IRB.\nTo get in contact please submit a ticket or reach out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am writing a proposal to use ABCD data, can you write a letter of support?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a practice the ABCD Coordinating Center (CC) and Data Analysis, Informatics, and Resource Center (DAIRC) do not provide letters that could be seen to endorse specific applications or projects that propose secondary analyses of the ABCD Study data.\nWhile we do not offer specific endorsements, we do offer our commitment to maintaining open lines of communication with the larger scientific community and to do whatever we can to ensure that they are able to acquire the information about the ABCD Data Resource that they may need to address their specific aims.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can I find the protocol for the ABCD study?\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation about ABCD study design & protocols are available in the Scientist section of the ABCD Study website or on this website here.\nPlease note that we are generally unable to share the specific measures used, as many are proprietary.\nAdditional details/resources are available on this site in documentation provided for each study instrument.\nYou can read more about the ABCD protocol development in a special issue of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/developmental-cognitive-neuroscience/vol/32.\nGeneral information about the studies data dictionary & release variables can explored via DEAP and Lasso (see details).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I propose a new assay for collected biospecimens?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, all analyzed specimens are part of the data release. NIDA has developed a mechanism for requestion biosamples for use. Pleae read more about the NBDC biospecimen access program here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutism in ABCD Study sample\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusion criteria for participation in the ABCD Study included “a current diagnosis of schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (moderate, severe), intellectual disability, or alcohol/substance use disorder. (A past diagnosis that has remitted is not exclusionary).” ABCD does not maintain assessments or records related to diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder. Though, the KSADS consists of diagnostic categories, including autism spectrum disorder (parent report only).\n\n\n\n\n\nData download & use\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I use ChatGPT or another AI tool to examine data, create figures, or otherwise understand ABCD data?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, this is not permitted. Inputting ABCD data to generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, is a violation of the terms of use outlined in the data use agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the cerebellum sometimes cutoff in fMRI and dMRI?\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries that pass raw QC may have some minor issues but are considered acceptable for processing. Because of relatively tight brain coverage for dMRI and fMRI acquisitions, the superior or inferior edge of the brain is sometimes outside of the stack of slices. We call this “field of view (FOV) cutoff”. Except in extreme cases, we do not exclude dMRI and fMRI series for mild to moderate FOV cutoff as part of our initial raw QC. Such cases are also not recommended for exclusion by default. In the tabulated imaging data, brain regions outside the FOV have missing values, but other regions remain usable.\nThe automated post-processing QC metrics include measures of superior and inferior FOV cutoff that can be used to exclude participants with FOV cutoff from analyses. See MRI post-processing QC Data Documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere are the dMRI gradient tables?\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw dMRI gradient tables can be found in the raw/ folder containing raw data standardized to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). See here for an overview the raw dMRI data. Processed gradient tables, adjusted for head rotation, are additionally provided in the QSIPrep derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen should I use field maps?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “minimally processed” (mproc) images have been corrected for B0 distortion using the field maps. As a result, field maps are not shared in the mproc data releases.\nIf you are obtaining fast track data (i.e., unprocessed), you would want to correct using the field maps provided in Fast Track.\nTo know which field map goes with a particular scan, here are some pointers:\n\nThe study date and series time are included in the fast track file names.\nThe protocol calls for two scans per task-fMRI session (i.e., two for MID, two for SST, and two for nBack).\nEach pair scans is typically preceded by a field map scan (or pair of field map scans).\nOn GE scanners, the field map is an integrated sequence of forward and reverse phase-encode polarity scans (i.e., one field map scan for GE). On Philips and Siemens scanners, the forward and reverse scans are separate series (i.e., two field map scans for Philips and Siemens).\n\nHere are some extra things to know:\n\nSometimes field map scans have image quality issues and may fail raw QC. Those will be excluded from Fast Track downloads if you access the “recommended” Fast Track query.\nIf there is no usable field map scan directly preceding a scan or pair of scans, we use the next closest field map in the imaging session.\nRegardless of whether the field map is collected immediately before the pair of tasks scans, or earlier, or later, it is advisable to correct for motion between the field map and the main scan.\nIf you use FSL’s TOPUP, it corrects for motion between the forward and reverse phase-encode polarity volumes, which occurs in many subjects as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre FreeSurfer processing outputs included in the data sharing?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. As of Release 6.0, FreeSurfer processing outputs are now included in the bids/derivatives/freesurfer output when downloading data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere can I find more information about the imaging protocol?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ABCD imaging protocol is described in Casey et al. (2018) and in our imaging documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do some imaging sessions, particularly from Philips scanners, have two or more dMRI series?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor imaging data from Philips scanners, the dMRI acquisition is split into two series because of a limitation of the Philips platform. Both scans have the same phase-encode polarity. They are meant to be concatenated together. In other rare cases, multiple dMRI scans may have been acquired, due to acquisition problems in early scans. For the minimally processed data, one scan is selected for each session based on QC ratings, except for Philips scanners, in which case two are selected for packaging and sharing. All scans are available as raw DICOM files via fasttrack data sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the ‘minimally processed’ imaging data?\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimally processed neuroimaging data include:\n\nHigh-resolution structural data (3D T1w and T2w scans)\nAdvanced diffusion MRI (multiple b-values and directions)\nResting-State fMRI\nTask fMRI (Monetary Incentive Delay, Stop-Signal, and Emotional N-Back), with event files for each fMRI run.\n\nThese series have been run through standard modality-specific pre-processing stages including conversion from raw to compressed files, distortion correction, movement correction, alignment to standard space, and initial quality control (refer to MRI Quality Control (QC) documentation). This is to enable researchers to use the ABCD neuroimaging data in their own processing pipelines more quickly and efficiently than starting with raw data. Note that minimal processing is identical for rs-fMRI and task-fMRI and does not include analysis-specific pre-processing steps (e.g. removal of initial TRs, normalization by mean, etc.). The available minimally processed files are detailed in the Other Imaging Instruments Data Documentation).\nPre-processed imaging data for each image series are shared in BIDS formatted directory trees as NIfTI format data files (software to share preprocessed data: https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016016; consistent with BIDS specifications version 1.1.1: https://bids.neuroimaging.io/standards/bids_specification/index.html). Imaging metadata derived from the original DICOM files are packaged along with each preprocessed data series as JSON files. The minimally processed T2w data are resampled into voxel-wise alignment with the T1w, which is rigid-body resampled into alignment with an atlas.\ndMRI-specific information included diffusion gradients adjusted for head rotation (bvecs.txt), diffusion gradient strengths (bvals.txt), and a rigid-body transformation matrix specifying the registration between the dMRI image and the corresponding processed sMRI T1w image (stored in the JSON file). The dMRI minimally processed data are also kept in their original resolution, but reoriented into a standard alignment, based on registration to T1w, but not voxel-wise aligned with the T1w. A registration matrix supplied with the minimally processed dMRI data.\nfMRI-specific information includes estimated motion time courses and a rigid-body transformation matrix specifying the registration between the fMRI image and the T1w image (stored in the JSON file). The fMRI minimally processed data are kept in their original space and resolution, but a registration matrix is supplied with the minimally processed fMRI data. For task-fMRI series, event timing information is included as tab-separated value (tsv) files. The results of additional processing and ROI analysis are shared as part of the tabulated data released through the NBDC Data Hub.\nInformation about this is included in the release notes, which also describe the processing steps included in the “minimally processed” data.\nThere is currently no script available to run the ABCD minimal processing. There is a Docker container and Singularity image that runs the complete processing and analysis pipeline that will be made available in the near future. Another useful software package is available here: https://github.com/ABCD-STUDY/abcd-hcp-pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich imaging data are recommended for use in analyses?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the Imaging release notes. There are modality-specific image inclusion flags, like mr_y_qc__incl__smri__t1_indicator or mr_y_qc__incl__rsfmri_indicator, that are either 0 or 1. The mr_y_qc__post__man__fsurf_score variable is used in the inclusion criteria to set the inclusion flags (criteria are listed in the release notes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are post-processing QC scores available for only a subset of imaging data?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described in the documentation, not all visits had manual post-processing QC; instead a sampling approach was used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat methods were used for processing the imaging data to produce the minimally processed and tabulated imaging data?\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to the Data Documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCasey, B.
