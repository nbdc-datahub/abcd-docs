<h1>Sample</h1>
<p>The 6.0 data release includes data from <em>11,868 participants</em>, representing the full ABCD cohort (N = 11,880) except for 12 participants who withdrew consent to share their data, and <em>13 events</em>. Data is considered complete through the 4-year follow-up and nearly complete for the 5-year follow-up, with varying numbers of missed visits per event. The 5.5-year and 6-year follow-up events were still ongoing when the data were frozen (cutoff date: January 15, 2025), so these events include only participants who had assented by the cutoff date. No data are included from events after the 6-year follow-up to ensure sufficient event completion.</p>

<h1>Curation &amp; structure</h1>
<p>In preparation for the 6.0 data release, the ABCD Study implemented new curation standards to improve the consistency, transparency, and usability of the release dataset. The curation standards and their implementation are described in more detail in the <a href="../../documentation/curation/structure.html">Curation &amp; structure</a> pages of the documentation. A high-level overview of the changes is provided below.</p>
<section id="bids-file-structure-and-identifier-columns" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bids-file-structure-and-identifier-columns">BIDS file structure and identifier columns</h2>
<p>The ABCD 6.0 data release includes a variety of data types and file formats, including <a href="../../documentation/curation/structure.html#tabulated">tabulated data</a> and <a href="../../documentation/curation/structure.html#file-based">file-based data</a>. Where possible, the data are organized in accordance with the <a href="https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)</a> standard, with some modifications to meet the specific needs of the ABCD Study®. BIDS is a widely adopted standard for organizing and formatting neuroimaging data, facilitating data sharing, processing, and analysis across various platforms and tools. We hope that this standardization will enhance the usability of the data and make it easier for researchers to work with the dataset.</p>
<p>As part of the BIDS standardization, we implemented the following changes to the names and values of the identifier columns used across the ABCD data resource:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifier Column Names:</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>participant_id</code> (replacing <code>src_subject_id</code> from previous releases)</li>
<li><code>session_id</code> (replacing <code>eventname</code> from previous releases)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Identifier Column Values:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use BIDS-specific prefixes (<code>sub-</code> for participant and <code>ses-</code> for session/event identifiers).</li>
<li><code>participant_id</code> values no longer include the <code>NDAR_INV</code> prefix (e.g., <code>sub-ABCD1234</code> instead of <code>NDAR_INVABCD1234</code>).</li>
<li><code>session_id</code> values are BIDS-compliant (e.g., without underscores) and standardized (see <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html#identifier-columns">here</a> for more details).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="naming-convention" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naming-convention">Naming convention</h2>
<p>For the 6.0 data release, the complete ABCD tabulated data resource has been re-curated using a <em>standardized naming convention</em>. This convention implements a keyword system that maps variables to summary scores, indicates branching logic and versioning, and links concepts across domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>A description of the new <strong>variable naming convention</strong> can be found <a href="../../documentation/curation/naming.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>A <strong>keyword glossary</strong> can be found <a href="../../documentation/curation/naming.html#glossary">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled" title="General design of the naming convention">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".callout-1-contents" aria-controls="callout-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle callout">

<div id="callout-1" class="callout-1-contents callout-collapse collapse">
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><code><span style="color: #BF0000; font-size: 24px">dm_s_tab_item</span></code></p>
<p>Variable names consist of four main components, each separated by a <em>single underscore</em>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Domain</li>
<li>Source/Recipient</li>
<li>Table</li>
<li>Item</li>
</ol>
<p>The table and item components may include additional subcomponents, which are separated by <em>multiple underscores</em> to indicate nesting within the four main components.</p>
<p>For detailed information about each component of the naming convention, please refer to the documentation <a href="../../documentation/curation/naming.html#components">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As a result, all variables in the tabulated dataset have been renamed according to this new convention. To facilitate the transition of existing workflows, we have retained the mapping to previously used variable and table names in the <a href="../../documentation/curation/metadata.html#dd_levels_tables">data dictionary</a> (see <a href="../../documentation/curation/metadata.html#add-info">here</a> for more details).</p>
<p>We recognize that this change will necessitate adjustments to current analysis pipelines and may introduce some initial friction. However, we believe that this recuration effort will ultimately benefit all users of the ABCD tabulated data resource. The new curation standard resolves many inconsistencies from previous releases and offers a clearer structure that is easier to search and process across the entire dataset.</p>
</section>
<section id="curation-standards" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="curation-standards">Curation standards</h2>
<p>As part of the recuration effort, we further standardized and improved the accompanying metadata.</p>
<ul>
<li>A general overview of the <strong>curation standards</strong> can be found <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Table-level standards</strong>, including participant and session/event IDs as well as collection timestamps and ages are described <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html#table-level-standards">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Variable-level standards</strong>, including the systematic encoding of variable and data types, measurement levels, units, variable labels, and coding standards are described <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html#variable-level-standards">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Label standards</strong> that were implemented to de-duplicate existing labels and ensure that the label for each variable can be understood on its own are described <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html#labels">here</a>. Additionally, the Spanish versions of labels were broken out into a separate column in the <a href="../../documentation/curation/metadata.html#dd_levels_tables">data dictionary</a> for improved readability.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="additional-metadata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-metadata">Additional metadata</h2>
<p>The data documentation website has been redesigned to better support responsible and informed data use. Notably, warnings that provide critical context for interpreting the data—such as potential quality concerns and guidance on appropriate usage—have been added throughout the website (see the <a href="../../usage/responsible_use.html">Responsible Use</a> page for more details).</p>
<p>To integrate the <a href="../../documentation/curation/metadata.html#dd_levels_tables">data dictionary</a> more closely with the information provided in the documentation, it now includes additional metadata. This metadata offers hyperlinks to responsible data use and data quality warnings, as well as links to the documentation pages for each table and any applicable summary score documentation for a given variable (see <a href="../../documentation/curation/metadata.html#add-info">here</a> for more details).</p>
</section>
<section id="re-coding" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="re-coding">Re-coding of categorical variables</h2>
<p>As part of the recuration process, we implemented consistent coding standards for all categorical variables in the tabulated data resource. This included standardizing the coded values for binary responses (e.g., <em>“Yes”/“No”</em> or <em>“True”/“False”</em>) and non-responses (e.g., <em>“Don’t know”</em> or <em>“Decline to answer”</em>). Additionally, we made changes to the coded values of some ordinal and semantic categories—such as grade levels, Likert scales, frequency responses, and income brackets—to create a more logical and intuitive order.</p>
<p>These updates ensure that researchers can more reliably interpret coded values for categorical variables across instruments and domains. Full details on the coding standards for binary and non-responses are provided <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html#coding-standards">here</a>. The table below lists all previously released variables that have been affected by these changes to help researchers adjust any existing analysis scripts accordingly.</p>

<section id="administration-timestamps-and-ages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="administration-timestamps-and-ages">Administration timestamps and ages</h2>
<p>In previous ABCD releases through the NIMH Data Archive (NDA), each table included an <code>interview_date</code> column. While the column name suggested that the data was collected on that date, it actually represented the start date of a visit and was duplicated across all tables. This approach did not account for multiday visits or other out-of-sync administrations.</p>
<p>For the 6.0 release, we introduced table-specific administration timepoint variables <code>{table_name}_dtt</code>, which reflect the actual date and time when the forms were administered, when available. This change allows for more precise temporal alignment. Additionally, based on these variables, we provide table-specific age variables <code>{table_name}_age</code> to enhance age-related analyses (see <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html#dtt-age">here</a> for more details).</p>
</section>
<section id="summary-scores" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-scores">Summary scores</h2>
<p>In an effort to correct errors, improve algorithms based on advancements in the relevant fields, increase consistency across measures and domains, and enhance transparency for users, all summary scores computed by the DAIRC<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> were re-developed for the 6.0 release. This includes both previously released summary scores and new scores developed since the last release.</p>
<p>The code to compute the various scores has been published as an R package called <code>ABCDscores</code> on <a href="https://github.com/nbdc-datahub/ABCDscores">GitHub</a> and is accompanied by a <a href="https://software.nbdc-datahub.org/ABCDscores">documentation website</a>. The goal of making the package public is to support transparency and reproducibility of ABCD release data by providing the exact algorithms and code used to compute the released summary scores. This allows users to tie a specific data release version to the corresponding version of the codebase (see also <a href="../../tools/r_packages.html#ABCDscores">here</a> for the rationale behind creating this R package).</p>
<p>The re-development aimed to implement consistent standards across domains. For example, a maximum of 20% missing ingoing items was established, and wherever possible, (prorated) sums were replaced with means. Additionally, variables reporting the total number of items in a score were removed, as they represent redundant information that does not vary between participants.</p>
<p>Due to the significant changes made to many summary scores included in previous releases, we did not maintain the mapping between current and legacy variable names (see <a href="../../documentation/curation/metadata.html#add-info">here</a>). This decision was made to indicate to users who may have used those variables in previous analyses that the contents may differ significantly in the 6.0 dataset. Direct comparisons should only be made after consulting <code>ABCDscores</code> and the accompanying documentation to understand the new algorithms.</p>

<section id="other-general-data-changes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-general-data-changes">Other general data changes</h2>
<p>During the recuration process, we made several general changes to the data structure and content to improve usability and consistency across the dataset. These changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In previous releases, variables that captured the same concept were sometimes named differently across different events. To reduce redundancy and confusion, these variables have been collapsed into a single variable.</li>
<li>Previously, all variables were associated with a longitudinal event. Static variables (such as race, ethnicity, genetic PCs, etc.) were typically linked to the baseline event. In the 6.0 release, static variables are now provided in static data tables—tables that do not include the session/event column <code>session_id</code> (see <a href="../../documentation/curation/standards.html#identifier-columns">here</a> for more details on the identifier columns). This change facilitates easier linking of static variables to the longitudinal data tables.</li>

<section id="school-and-district-ids" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="school-and-district-ids">School and district IDs</h3>
<p>For the 6.0 release, school and district IDs were amended due to the following changes. Please note that these changes are specific to the pseudo school ID <code>ab_g_dyn__design_id__district</code> and <code>ab_g_dyn__design_id__school</code> and do not impact the linked SEDA data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional data were recovered from earlier data collection interfaces. These data were used to recalculate available data as prior data releases had applied a filter restricting inclusion to cases with &gt;= 10 pseudo IDs.</li>
<li>Private schools without an NCES ID were inaccurately assigned an anonymized district ID. These district IDs were removed for the 6.0 release.</li>
<li>In prior releases, when an informant reported that a participant was homeschooled, <code>school_id</code> was recoded to ‘0.’ However, in the 6.0 release, participants who were homeschooled were not given a <code>ab_g_dyn__design_id__school</code>/<code>ab_g_dyn__design_id__district</code> unless their homeschooling was associated with an NCES school/district identification number.</li>

<p>In the 6.0 release, we corrected a small number of errors in the site ID variable, <code>ab_g_dyn__design_site</code>. Please disregard information about sites in prior releases in favor of the 6.0 release data. The site ID is now provided as a categorical variable that lists the site names (e.g., <code>"1"</code>=‘<em>Children’s Hospital Los Angeles</em>’) instead of a coded variable (e.g., <code>"site01"</code>).</p>
</section>
<section id="ethno-racial-identity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethno-racial-identity">Ethno-racial identity</h3>
<p>Several new ethno-racial identity summary score variables are available in the data release, capturing ethnicity and race based on baseline and longitudinal responses from youth and parents:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ab_g_stc__cohort_ethn</code>: Hispanic vs.&nbsp;non-Hispanic classification<br>
</li>
<li><code>ab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__leg</code>: 6-level legacy classification prioritizing Hispanic ethnicity<br>
</li>
<li><code>ab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__mblack</code>: 8-level classification highlighting Black identity in multiracial endorsements<br>

<li><code>ab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__mhisp</code>: 8-level classification highlighting Hispanic identity in multiracial endorsements<br>
</li>
<li><code>ab_g_stc__cohort_ethnrace__meim</code>: 15-level classification based on MEIM responses<br>
</li>
<li><code>ab_g_stc__cohort_race__nih</code>: 7-level classification based on NIH standards</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these variables are newly introduced in Release 6.0. More detail on how they are computed is available in the <a href="https://software.nbdc-datahub.org/ABCDscores/reference/index.html#abcd-static-variables-general-"><code>ABCDscores</code></a> package.</p>
</section>
<section id="household-income" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="household-income">Household income</h3>
<p>A new household income variable (<code>ab_g_dyn__cohort_income__hhold__3lvl</code>) was created with three distinct levels (as well as <code>"999"</code>=<em>‘Do not know’</em> and <code>"777"</code>=<em>‘Decline to answer’</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;$50,000</li>
<li>$50,000 to &lt;$100,000</li>
<li>&gt;=$100,000</li>
</ul>
<p>This variable was developed to offer a convenient categorization of household income, reflecting a common practice among researchers using ABCD data. The selection of cut-offs for each income level was informed by an analysis of alternative categorization methods and a careful examination of cell sizes across all study time points. The goal was to ensure sufficient representation within each level while maintaining the meaningfulness of the income brackets.</p>
<p>This new variable is intended to facilitate ease of use in analysis, particularly for studies where more granular detail is not required. However, more detailed versions of the household income variable also remain available in the dataset (e.g.&nbsp;a variable with 5 levels, <code>ab_g_dyn__cohort_income__hhold__5lvl</code>).</p>
</section>
<section id="anonymized-date-of-birth" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anonymized-date-of-birth">Anonymized Date of Birth</h3>
<p>We changed the algorithm for how anonymized birthdates are computed in the 6.0 release. In previous releases, the algorithm always used the 15th day of the month in which a participant was born (for example, if a participant was born on April 18th, 2010, their anonymized birthdate was set to April 15th, 2010).</p>
<p>In the new algorithm, we first determine whether a participant’s birthday falls in the first half (1st–15th) or second half (16th–end) of the month. Then, for each birthday, we randomly select a new day within the same half of the month.</p>

Researchers interested in using these data are encouraged to create their own summary scores using the individual <code>pbp</code> items that best suit their specific analyses.</p>
</section>
<section id="values-scale-summary-scores" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="values-scale-summary-scores">Values Scale summary scores</h3>
<p>The Values Scale currently lacks a summary score for the <em>familism subscale</em>, which will be included in a future data release. The familism construct is computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline through 5-Year event</strong>: mean of the 17 items from the three scales:
<ul>
<li>“Family Support”</li>
<li>“Family Referent”</li>
<li>“Family Obligation”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Starting 6-Year event</strong>: mean of the 11 items from the two scales:
<ul>
<li>“Family Support”</li>
<li>“Family Referent”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The summary score computation will be included soon in the <a href="https://software.nbdc-datahub.org/ABCDscores/"><code>ABCDscores</code></a> package and can be used in analyses of 6.0 data.</p>

<p>In previous data releases, family relatedness was captured by <code>rel_family_id</code>, this variable is now named <code>gn_y_genrel_id__fam</code> in the genetics table and crosslisted as <code>ab_g_stc__design_id__fam__gen</code> in the <code>ab_g_stc</code> table.</p>

As such addresses reflect participants’ addresses at <strong>baseline</strong> (e.g., <code>addr1</code> is primary address at baseline, <code>addr2</code> secondary address at baseline, <code>addr3</code> tertiary address at baseline).</p>
<p>We recognize this limitation and the LED Environment and Policy Workgroup has improved the collection of residential history data for more temporal and geographic accuracy of participants’ reported addresses. Future releases will incorporate more comprehensive and accurate address data, but until then, users should be mindful of the limitations of currently available data.</p>

<p>As part of the 6.0 curation efforts, ABCD merged data from KSADS 1.0 and 2.0 in order to combine all equivalent symptoms and diagnoses across the two assessment versions into singular variables. However, we were unable to complete this process for the item-level KSADS data. As a result, the 6.0 release does not include individual items, but these will be included in a future release.</p>
<p>Additionally, the symptoms and diagnoses have been moved from a ‘summary scores’ table into their respective module’s table.</p>

<p>The Mental Health Workgroup did an extensive review of the criteria used for all previously released eating disorder diagnoses in KSADS. The group agreed that the criterion were more restrictive than necessary, and thus underestimated the rates of eating disorder diagnoses. Thus, they determined these diagnoses should be removed from the 6.0 release and recommend users should create their own diagnoses summary scores using the symptom data.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Mental Health Workgroup is working with KSADS to create more accurate diagnoses, which we hope to include in the 7.0 data release.</p>

<p><strong>The following corrections have been made ahead of the 6.0 release:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There was an error discovered (12/2022) where repeated substance use events on the TLFB were only recorded once in the individual day-level data files utilized for the calendar scoring; this was corrected in the day-level and calculated data for all waves.</li>
<li>Reports of edibles and MJ concentrates measured in <code>mg</code> have been converted to <code>occasions</code> for consistency across data waves.</li>
<li>In the original TLFB application (prior to 9/2023), errors were noted counting some estimated periods as detailed periods; this was fixed in the current release and any data collected &gt;12 months from SU interview were coded as estimated period.</li>
<li>Maximum daily standard unit dose limits were instituted on the TLFB across all waves to date to reduce outlier events.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6.0 data release known issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is missing TLFB data for some youth participants; some is due to COVID-19 related administration in the home and privacy concerns; others are missing due to research assistant (RA) error (i.e., youth reported using a drug, but RA did not launch TLFB to measure detailed dose/patterns). See <code>su_y_tlfb_adm</code> for SU interview completion details, and variables starting with <code>su_y_tlfb_adm__rmt</code> for details on remote visits.</p></li>
<li><p>Some youth have 0’s in their individual TLFB summary data, this occurred rarely if an RA launched the TLFB, put in an initial date of use but did not record any standard units (denoted as N/A in day-level data; this occurred rarely when a youth initially reported using, but then denied use). This issue issue is corrected with the new TLFB app.</p></li>
<li><p>We discovered an error in the formula used to calculate all <strong>“3-month use days”</strong> variables (suffix <code>_3mo_ud</code>). The formula incorrectly used <code>60</code> days instead of <code>90</code>, meaning these variables reflect the <strong>last 60 days</strong> of use rather than the intended <strong>last 90 days</strong>.

<section id="event-timing-offset-for-ge-scanners" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="event-timing-offset-for-ge-scanners">Event timing offset for GE scanners</h4>
<p>There was previously a discrepancy in how stimulus times were modeled relative to the end of the calibration/dummy volumes in the image acquisition that affects GE scanners. The issue is related to how the E-prime tasks were programmed for GE scanners that resulted in an unexpected timing offset of 800 msec or less.</p>
<p>We modified our code for extracting event timing information from ABCD E-prime files (https://github.com/ABCD-STUDY/abcd_extract_eprime.git). Rather than rely on the first fixation event (e.g., CueFix.OnsetTime) the modified code now uses the timing data from the initial and or final trigger events (e.g., GetReady.RTTime) to determine the reference time that represents the start of the first non-dummy image volume. We also modified the number of initial volumes discarded prior to task fMRI time series analysis for GE scanners, with 4 volumes removed for GE DV26 and 15 volumes removed for GE DV26 and later.</p>

<section id="e-prime-timing-errors-for-ge-scanners" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e-prime-timing-errors-for-ge-scanners">E-Prime timing errors for GE scanners</h4>
<p>In a relatively small, though substantial, subset of task fMRI acquisitions collected on GE scanners (~9% of runs), the time between the 1st and 16th trigger pulse sent from the scanner does not match the expected 12 seconds.</p>
<p>We modified our task fMRI analysis pipeline to calculate trigger pulse timing discrepancies to identify E-prime runs for which the delay between the first trigger pulse and last recorded trigger pulse does not match the expectation (12 seconds for GE scanners). In cases where the discrepancy was either 0.8, 1.6, or 2.4 seconds (or within 0.01 seconds of those values), indicating missed (undetected) trigger pulses (~3% of runs), we adjusted the start time (used as the reference for subsequent events) by subtracting the discrepancy. We further modified the task fMRI analysis pipeline to exclude from processing any other runs that had a start time discrepancy (absolute difference from expectation relative to initial trigger pulse) larger than 0.5 seconds (~6% of runs), as such cases reflect irregular trigger timing and make it difficult or impossible to be sure when the stimulus run started relative to the imaging scan. For imaging visits with no valid task fMRI runs due to timing discrepancies, no derived results will be produced, and the imaging inclusion flags for the corresponding task will be set to 0. See <a href="../../documentation/imaging/type_tfmri.html">Data Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We also sought to identify runs for which the delay between the start of the run and the onset of the first fixation does not match the expectation (500 msec for 1st nBack run on GE scanners, 0 msec otherwise). Runs with an onset time delay greater than 5 seconds were excluded from processing. Smaller discrepancies (i.e., up to 5 seconds) were allowed for this type of delay, because they do not introduce an error in the time series analysis, like an unknown delay between the start of the scan and the start of the run would. Instead, there is merely a shift in the timing of events relative to the start of the run, which can be correctly modeled.</p>

<p>A data integrity issue was identified in the <a href="../../documentation/substudy/sdev.html#sdev_p_vict"><code>Victimization [Parent]</code></a> measure, affecting 273 item instances in which questions were presented out of order and improperly labeled, making item data for these instances therefore unreliable in the dataset.</p>
<p>The error occurred only in select instances after the first assessment wave (<code>ses-S01</code>) and was corrected in December 2023, so data collected after that date are correct. The “gating” questions (with response options ‘Yes’ or ‘No’) are correct, although the order of presentation may have varied. Data were erroneous during this period in instances when the parent endorsed more than one “gating” question. Since multiple follow up questions are displayed for each “gating” question, the follow up questions being presented out of order resulted in response variables being out of order in the dataset and potentially making it unclear to parents which events they were answering follow up questions about.</p>
<p>We therefore excluded any of these follow up items from the release data, creating some missingness in the dataset where an individual may have responded “yes” to the gating question, but have no follow up responses. The specific follow up variables affected and excluded are listed below:</p>
