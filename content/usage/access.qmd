# Data access

Access to ABCD Study data is managed through the [NIH Brain Development Cohorts](https://www.nbdc-datahub.org/) Data Use Certification (DUC) process. To qualify for access, the following requirements must be met:

- You must have a legitimate research purpose for using the data.
- You must be affiliated with an NIH-recognized research institution and obtain approval from an institutional signing official. 
- Your institution must hold an active [Federal Wide Assurance (FWA)](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/fwas/fwa-protection-of-human-subjecct/index.html) for the Protection of Human Subjects.

For complete details on the dataset access process, visit the [NBDC website](https://www.nbdc-datahub.org/data-access-process). Frequently asked questions about data access are covered [here](https://nbdc-splash-beta.lassoinformatics.com/faqs).

## What to do prior to your DUC approval? 

Both data access applications, [Data Exploration & Analysis Portal (DEAP)](https://abcd.deapscience.com) and the [NBDC Data Access Platform](https://nbdc-datashare.lassoinformatics.com), offer the ability to explore the ABCD data dictionary without a DUC. Once you get your DUC you will be able to start compiling & creating datasets for use. 

- [DEAP Data Dictionary & Ontology Explorer](https://abcd.deapscience.com/#/my-datasets/create-dataset)
- [Data Access Platform Query Tool](https://nbdc-datashare.lassoinformatics.com/)

Understanding the ABCD variable naming structure is extremely helpful in navigating our large data set and using applications like DEAP & the NBDC Data Access Platform. You can learn more about ABCD's data assets at the below resources: 

- [Data structure](../documentation/curation/structure.qmd)
- [Naming conventions](../documentation/curation/naming.qmd)
- [Non-imaging protocol documentation](../documentation/non_imaging/ab.qmd)
