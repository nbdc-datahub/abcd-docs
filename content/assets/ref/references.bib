  abstract = {Abstract Background and Aims Initial subjective reactions to cannabis and tobacco, broadly classified as positive or negative, have previously been explored for their associations with onset and maintenance of subsequent abuse/dependence. We examine (i) the factorial architecture of self-reported initial reactions to cannabis and tobacco; (ii) whether these factors associate with concurrently reported age at onset of DSM - IV diagnosis of nicotine dependence and cannabis abuse/dependence; and (iii) estimate heritable variation in and covariation between the factors. Design Factorial and exploratory structural equation modeling was conducted to examine the factor structure of initial reactions. C ox proportional hazards modeling was employed to examine their association with time to onset of diagnosis of DSM - IV nicotine dependence and cannabis abuse/dependence. Classical twin modeling, using univariate and multivariate models, was used to parse variance in each factor (and the covariance between factors) to their additive genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental sources. Setting and Participants General population sample of C aucasian female twins aged 18--32 years, with a life-time history of tobacco [ n = 2393] and cannabis [ n = 1445] use. Measurement Self-report of initial subjective reactions to tobacco (cigarettes) and cannabis the first time they were used and time to onset of life-time history of DSM - IV diagnosis of abuse (cannabis) and dependence (cannabis or nicotine). Findings Factors representing putatively positive and negative reactions to cannabis and tobacco emerged. Initial reactions to tobacco were associated with onset of DSM - IV diagnosis of nicotine dependence and cannabis abuse/dependence while initial reactions to cannabis were associated with onset of DSM - IV diagnosis of cannabis abuse/dependence alone. Genetic factors played a moderate role in each factor (heritability of 27--35\%, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05), with the remaining variance attributed to individual--specific environment. Covariation across the factors indexing positive and negative initial reactions was attributable to genetic sources (0.18--0.58, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) and to overlapping individual-specific environmental factors (-0.16 to 0.36, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Conclusions Initial subjective reactions to tobacco are associated with onset of DSM - IV diagnosis of nicotine dependence and cannabis abuse/dependence while initial subjective reactions to cannabis are only associated with onset of diagnosis of DSM - IV cannabis abuse/dependence. Genetic and environmental factors underpin the overlap across the factors representing initial reactions, both positive and negative.},

The NLAAS is nationally representative community household survey that estimates the prevalence of mental disorders and rates of mental health service utilization by Latinos and Asian Americans in the US. The central aims of the NLAAS are to: 1) describe the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders and the rates of mental health services use for Latino and Asian American populations using nationwide representative samples of Latinos and Asian Americans, 2) assess the associations among social position, environmental context, and psychosocial factors with the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and utilization rates of mental health services, and 3) compare the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders, and utilization of mental health services of Latinos and Asian Americans with national representative samples of non-Latino whites (from the National Comorbidity Study-Replication) (NCS-R) and African Americans (from the National Survey of American Life) (NSAL). This paper presents new concepts and methods utilized in the development of the NLAAS to capture and investigate ethnic, cultural and environmental considerations that are often ignored in mental health research.

Through the longitudinal, U.S.-based Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, youth (mage=14; n=1,415) self-reported their typical smartphone use and passively recorded three weeks of smartphone use via the ABCD-specific Effortless Assessment Research System (EARS) application. Here we describe and validate passively-sensed smartphone keyboard and app use measures, provide code to harmonize measures across operating systems, and describe trends in adolescent smartphone use. Keyboard and app-use measures were reliable and positively correlated with one another (r=0.33) and with self-reported use (rs=0.21-0.35). Participants recorded a mean of 5hrs of daily smartphone use, two more hours than they reported, with females using more than males. Smartphone use was recorded at all hours, peaking from 8-10PM and lowest from 3-5AM. Social media and texting apps comprised nearly half of all use. Data are openly available to approved investigators (https://nda.nih.gov/abcd/). Information herein can inform use of the ABCD dataset to longitudinally study health and neurodevelopmental correlates of adolescent smartphone use.}

  abstract = {Pediatricians across the United States encounter infants, children, adolescents, young adults, and families affected by substance use disorders in their daily practice. For much of history, substance use has been viewed as a moral failing for which individuals themselves are to blame; however, as addiction became understood as a medical disorder, clinical terminology has shifted along with a growing awareness of harm of stigmatizing language in medicine. In issuing this policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) joins other large organizations in providing recommendations regarding medically accurate, person-first, and nonstigmatizing terminology. As the first pediatric society to offer guidance on preferred language regarding substance use to be used among pediatricians, media, policymakers, and government agencies and in its own peer-reviewed publications, the AAP aims to promote child health by highlighting the specific context of infants, children, adolescents, young adults, and families. In this policy statement, the AAP provides 3 specific recommendations, accompanied by a table that presents a summary of problematic language to be avoided, paired with the recommended more appropriate language and explanations for each. Pediatricians have an important role in advocating for the health of children and adolescents in the context of families affected by substance use and are optimally empowered to do so by avoiding the use of stigmatizing language in favor of medically accurate terminology that respects the dignity and personhood of individuals with substance use disorders and the children and adolescents raised in families affected by substance use.},

Here, we developed the first national super-learned models across the US for hyperlocal estimation of annual mean elemental carbon (EC), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), organic carbon (OC), and sulfate (SO42-) concentrations across 3,535 urban areas at a 50-m spatial resolution, and at a 1-km resolution for non-urban areas from 2000 to 2019. Using ensembles of machine learning models and {\textasciitilde}82 billion predictions across 20 years, hyperlocal super-learned PM2.5 components are now available for further research. We found remarkable spatiotemporal intra-urban and inter-urban variabilities in PM2.5 components. We anticipate our work to be a critical milestone for conducting new studies on individual and combined health risks of PM2.5 components, environmental justice analysis, or understanding fine-scale spatiotemporal variabilities of PM2.5 composition. Urban planners and regulators may also use these predictions for selecting locations of new daycares, schools, nursing homes, or air-quality monitors.},

That item within each of the six addiction elements with the highest corrected item-total correlation was retained in the final scale. The factor structure of the scale was good (RMSEA = .046, CFI = .99) and coefficient alpha was .83. The 3-week test-retest reliability coefficient was .82. The scores converged with scores for other scales of Facebook activity. Also, they were positively related to Neuroticism and Extraversion, and negatively related to Conscientiousness.

Its specific aims are: 1) to describe the prevalence and severity of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in children living in different centres, and to make comparisons within and between countries; 2) to obtain baseline measures for assessment of future trends in the prevalence and severity of these diseases; and 3) to provide a framework for further aetiological research into genetic, lifestyle, environmental, and medical care factors affecting these diseases. The ISAAC design comprises three phases. Phase 1 uses core questionnaires designed to assess the prevalence and severity of asthma and allergic disease in defined populations. Phase 2 will investigate possible aetiological factors, particularly those suggested by the findings of Phase 1. Phase 3 will be a repetition of Phase 1 to assess trends in prevalence.},

  abstract = {The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study of 11,880 youth incorporates a comprehensive range of measures assessing predictors and outcomes related to mental health across childhood and adolescence in participating youth, as well as information about family mental health history. We have previously described the logic and content of the mental health assessment battery at Baseline and 1-year follow-up. Here, we describe changes to that battery and issues and clarifications that have emerged, as well as additions to the mental health battery at the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year follow-ups. We capitalize on the recent release of longitudinal data for caregiver and youth report of mental health data to evaluate trajectories of dimensions of psychopathology as a function of demographic factors. For both caregiver and self-reported mental health symptoms, males showed age-related decreases in internalizing and externalizing symptoms, while females showed an increase in internalizing symptoms with age. Multiple indicators of socioeconomic status (caregiver education, family income, financial adversity, neighborhood poverty) accounted for unique variance in both caregiver and youth-reported externalizing and internalizing symptoms. These data highlight the importance of examining developmental trajectories of mental health as a function of key factors such as sex and socioeconomic environment.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, no reference standards currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics over time, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and weight1. Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data (http://www.brainchart.io/). With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories2 of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones3, showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes.},

At the core of this study are the three tasks that are completed repeatedly within the fMRI scanner, one of which is the stop-signal task. Laudably, the materials and data from this study are being made openly available to the community. However, in analyzing the available experimental code and data for the stop-signal task, we identified a set of design issues that we believe significantly limit its value. These issues include but are not limited to: variable stimulus durations that violate basic assumptions of dominant stopping models, trials in which stimuli are incorrectly not presented, and degenerate stop-signal delays. We present eight issues, show their effect on the existing ABCD data, suggest prospective solutions to the study organizers including task changes for future data collection, and suggest retrospective solutions for data users who wish to make the most of the existing data.},

Participants: A total of 224 persons with a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) enrolled in the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems National Database. Design: Following standard administration of the follow-up interview, a second interview was administered 14 to 28 days later using the same interviewer and the same mode of administration. Main Measures: Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems follow-up interview that includes 66 variables comprised ( a ) single item measures of demographics; employment; general health as well as specific health conditions; rehospitalization; tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; transportation; and mental health and ( b ) multi-item instruments: FIM; Participation Assessment With Recombined Tools-Objective; Disability Rating Scale; Glasgow Outcome Scale---Extended; Supervision Rating Scale; Satisfaction With Life Scale; TBI Quality of Life Anxiety and Depression items; and The Ohio State University TBI Identification Method. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.65 to 0.99, weighted kappa values ranged from 0.54 to 0.99, and kappa values ranged from 0.43 to 1.00. Four kappa/weighted kappa estimates fell below 0.60: arrested, psychiatric hospitalization, number of days not in good physical health, and rating of general emotional health. Conclusions: With few exceptions, good to excellent test-retest reliability estimates were obtained. The findings support the use of these measures in prior and future studies and indicate that persons with moderate-severe TBI can provide reliable self-report.},

  abstract = {Youth self-reports are a mainstay of delinquency assessment; however, making valid inferences about delinquency using these assessments requires equivalent measurement across groups of theoretical interest. We examined whether a brief 10-item delinquency measure exhibited measurement invariance across non-Hispanic White ( n = 6,064) and Black ( n = 1,666) youth (ages 10--11 years old) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development sm Study (ABCD Study{\textregistered}). We detected differential item functioning (DIF) in two items. Black youth were more likely to report being arrested or picked up by police than White youth with the same score on the latent delinquency trait. Although multiple covariates (income, urgency, and callous--unemotional traits) reduced mean-level difference in overall delinquency, they were generally unrelated to the DIF in the Arrest item. However, the DIF in the Arrest item was reduced in size and no longer significant after adjusting for neighborhood safety. Results illustrate the importance of considering measurement invariance when using self-reported delinquency scores to draw inferences about group differences, and the utility of measurement invariance analyses for helping to identify mechanisms that contribute to group differences generally.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY To attempt a categorization of sleep disorders in children, we developed a 27 item Likert-type rating scale (Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children: SDSC) and assessed the psychometric properties was developed. The scale was distributed to the mothers of 1304 children (1157 controls, mean age 9.8y; 147 sleep disorder subjects, mean age 9.2y, composed of four clinical groups: Insomnia 39 subjects, Hypersomnia 12 subjects, Respiratory disturbances during sleep 25 subjects and Parasomnias 71 subjects). The internal consistency was high in controls (0.79) and remained at a satisfactory level in sleep disorder subjects (0.71); the test/retest reliability was adequate for the total (r = 0.71) and single item scores. The factor analysis (variance explained 44.21\%) yielded six factors which represented the most common areas of sleep disorders in childhood and adolescence. Enuresis was the only item with a factor loading lower than 0.40 and with a low inter-item correlation and was therefore eliminated, resulting in a final scale of 26 items. The re-evaluation of the sample, using the factor scores, supported the validity and the discriminating capacity of the scales between controls and the four clinical groups. The correlation between factor scores corroborated the hypothesis that childhood sleep disturbances are not independent entities nor do they cluster into different groupings related to each other. The SDSC appears to be a useful tool in evaluating the sleep disturbances of school-age children in clinical and non-clinical populations.},

  abstract = {Emotion dysregulation is associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and confers risk for behavior problems and functional impairment; however, there is little guidance on best practices for measurement in adolescents. We developed a parent-report version of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-P). Evidence of reliability and validity was evaluated in a large community online sample (Study 1: n = 978; M age = 13.52 years; SD = 1.93) and in two samples of adolescents with ADHD (Study 2, Sample 1: n = 78; M age = 12.12 years, SD = 0.91; Sample 2: n = 206; M age = 15.35 years; SD = 0.85). A four-factor solution of the DERS-P was obtained in Study 1 and confirmed in Study 2, with factors demonstrating acceptable internal consistency. The community sample was generally rated as less dysregulated than the ADHD samples. Support was obtained for convergent, concurrent, and incremental validity evidence. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the DERS-P as a psychometrically sound parent-report measure of emotion dysregulation in 11- to 17-year-old adolescents.},

  abstract = {Good data curation is integral to cohort studies, but it is not always done to a level necessary to ensure the longevity of the data a study holds. In this opinion paper, we introduce the concept of data curation debt-the data curation equivalent to the software engineering principle of technical debt. Using the context of UK cohort studies, we define data curation debt-describing examples and their potential impact. We highlight that accruing this debt can make it more difficult to use the data in the future. Additionally, the long-running nature of cohort studies means that interest is accrued on this debt and compounded over time-increasing the impact a debt could have on a study and its stakeholders. Primary causes of data curation debt are discussed across three categories: longevity of hardware, software and data formats; funding; and skills shortages. Based on cross-domain best practice, strategies to reduce the debt and preventive measures are proposed-with importance given to the recognition and transparent reporting of data curation debt. Describing the debt in this way, we encapsulate a multi-faceted issue in simple terms understandable by all cohort study stakeholders. Data curation debt is not only confined to the UK, but is an issue the international community must be aware of and address. This paper aims to stimulate a discussion between cohort studies and their stakeholders on how to address the issue of data curation debt. If data curation debt is left unchecked it could become impossible to use highly valued cohort study data, and ultimately represents an existential risk to studies themselves.},

However, the patterns observed in these datasets are more likely to be influenced by upstream structural inequities (i.e., structural racism), which can lead to health disparities based on race, ethnicity, and social class. This paper addresses the need for guidance and self-reflection in biomedical research on conceptualizing, contextualizing, and communicating issues related to race and ethnicity. We provide recommendations as a starting point for researchers to rethink race and ethnicity choices in study design, model specification, statistical analysis, and communication of results, implement practices to avoid the further stigmatization of historically minoritized groups, and engage in research practices that counteract existing harmful biases.}

A battery of neuroimaging tasks are administered biennially to track neurodevelopment and identify individual differences in brain function. This study reports activation patterns from functional MRI (fMRI) tasks completed at baseline, which were designed to measure cognitive impulse control with a stop signal task (SST; N\,=\,5,547), reward anticipation and receipt with a monetary incentive delay (MID) task (N\,=\,6,657) and working memory and emotion reactivity with an emotional N-back (EN-back) task (N\,=\,6,009). Further, we report the spatial reproducibility of activation patterns by assessing between-group vertex/voxelwise correlations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation. Analyses reveal robust brain activations that are consistent with the published literature, vary across fMRI tasks/contrasts and slightly correlate with individual behavioral performance on the tasks. These results establish the preadolescent brain function baseline, guide interpretation of cross-sectional analyses and will enable the investigation of longitudinal changes during adolescent development.},

In this paper, the effects of DWI artifacts on estimated tensor values, such as trace and fractional anisotropy, are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations. A novel approach for robust diffusion tensor estimation, called RESTORE (for robust estimation of tensors by outlier rejection), is proposed. This method uses iteratively reweighted least-squares regression to identify potential outliers and subsequently exclude them. Results from both simulated and clinical diffusion data sets indicate that the RESTORE method improves tensor estimation compared to the commonly used linear and nonlinear least-squares tensor fitting methods and a recently proposed method based on the Geman--McClure M-estimator. The RESTORE method could potentially remove the need for cardiac gating in DWI acquisitions and should be applicable to other MR imaging techniques that use univariate or multivariate regression to fit MRI data to a model.

  abstract = {Building the Brain Brain connectivity is often described as a network of discrete independent cables analogous to a switchboard, but how is the physical structure of the brain constructed (see the Perspective by Zilles and Amunts )? Wedeen et al. (p. 1628 ) used high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging in humans and four species of nonhuman primates to identify and compare the geometric structure of large fiber tracts in the brain. Fiber tracts followed a highly constrained and regular geometry, which may provide an efficient solution for pathfinding during ontogenetic development. Much of development occurs through elaboration and assembly of semiautonomous building blocks. Chen et al. (p. 1634 ) applied statistical analysis to the form of the human cortex in brain-imaging studies that compared more than 400 di- and mono-zygotic twins. The findings suggest that the structure of the human cortex is defined by genetics. , Human brain structure is genetically controlled in a hierarchical, modular, and symmetric fashion. , Surface area of the cerebral cortex is a highly heritable trait, yet little is known about genetic influences on regional cortical differentiation in humans. Using a data-driven, fuzzy clustering technique with magnetic resonance imaging data from 406 twins, we parceled cortical surface area into genetic subdivisions, creating a human brain atlas based solely on genetically informative data. Boundaries of the genetic divisions corresponded largely to meaningful structural and functional regions; however, the divisions represented previously undescribed phenotypes different from conventional (non--genetically based) parcellation systems. The genetic organization of cortical area was hierarchical, modular, and predominantly bilaterally symmetric across hemispheres. We also found that the results were consistent with human-specific regions being subdivisions of previously described, genetically based lobar regionalization patterns.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Population structure inference with genetic data has been motivated by a variety of applications in population genetics and genetic association studies. Several approaches have been proposed for the identification of genetic ancestry differences in samples where study participants are assumed to be unrelated, including principal components analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and model-based methods for proportional ancestry estimation. Many genetic studies, however, include individuals with some degree of relatedness, and existing methods for inferring genetic ancestry fail in related samples. We present a method, PC-AiR, for robust population structure inference in the presence of known or cryptic relatedness. PC-AiR utilizes genome-screen data and an efficient algorithm to identify a diverse subset of unrelated individuals that is representative of all ancestries in the sample. The PC-AiR method directly performs PCA on the identified ancestry representative subset and then predicts components of variation for all remaining individuals based on genetic similarities. In simulation studies and in applications to real data from Phase III of the HapMap Project, we demonstrate that PC-AiR provides a substantial improvement over existing approaches for population structure inference in related samples. We also demonstrate significant efficiency gains, where a single axis of variation from PC-AiR provides better prediction of ancestry in a variety of structure settings than using 10 (or more) components of variation from widely used PCA and MDS approaches. Finally, we illustrate that PC-AiR can provide improved population stratification correction over existing methods in genetic association studies with population structure and relatedness.},

The authors acquired teacher reports of RSB in 287 schoolchildren and parent reports of RSB in 158 child psychiatric patients using a new research instrument, the Social Reciprocity Scale. Total scores on this measure of RSB were continuously distributed in all groups of subjects; children with PDDs scored significantly higher for the degree of deficits in RSB than did clinical or nonclinical controls. Latent class analysis and factor analysis failed to demonstrate separate categories of deficiency for core autistic symptomatology and more general impairments in RSB, consistent with the notion of a "broader autism phenotype." Assessments of RSB on a continuous scale may be useful clinically for characterizing the behavior of children whose social deficits fall below the threshold for a full diagnosis of autism. They may also be useful in genetic-linkage studies of autistic spectrum disorders.},

  abstract = {Background: Although DSM-IV requires symptoms in three criterion domains for a diagnosis of autistic disorder, the extent to which those domains are phenotypically independent is an unanswered and important question. The identification of `endophenotypes' of the autistic syndrome may be very useful for genetic and neurobiologic studies of autism, but only if they represent truly independent sub domains of the disorder. Methods: In this study we examined the factor structure of autistic traits using data from 226 child psychiatric patients with and without pervasive developmental disorders, employing cluster analysis of data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-r) and principal components factor analysis of data from the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS, a quantitative genetic measure of autistic traits formerly known as the Social Reciprocity Scale). Results: The results were consistent with the existence of a singular, continuously distributed underlying factor, resulting in disparate phenotypic manifestations across the three criterion domains for autistic disorder (social deficits, language deficits, and repetitive/stereotypic behaviors). Conclusion: The analyses generally failed to support the existence of independent sub domains of dysfunction in autism spectrum conditions. Future studies of the association between genetic/neurobiologic markers and autistic symptomatology may be enhanced by approaches which consider autistic symptoms as quantitative traits, and which are informed by ongoing research on the development and phenomenology of core deficiencies in reciprocal social behavior.},

  abstract = {Abstract We describe a comprehensive linear approach to the problem of imaging brain activity with high temporal as well as spatial resolution based on combining EEG and MEG data with anatomical constraints derived from MRI images. The "inverse problem" of estimating the distribution of dipole strengths over the cortical surface is highly underdetermined, even given closely spaced EEG and MEG recordings. We have obtained much better solutions to this problem by explicitly incorporating both local cortical orientation as well as spatial covariance of sources and sensors into our formulation. An explicit polygonal model of the cortical manifold is first constructed as follows: (1) slice data in three orthogonal planes of section (needle-shaped voxels) are combined with a linear deblurring technique to make a single high-resolution 3-D image (cubic voxels), (2) the image is recursively flood-filled to determine the topology of the gray-white matter border, and (3) the resulting continuous surface is refined by relaxing it against the original 3-D gray-scale image using a deformable template method, which is also used to computationally flatten the cortex for easier viewing. The explicit solution to an error minimization formulation of an optimal inverse linear operator (for a particular cortical manifold, sensor placement, noise and prior source covariance) gives rise to a compact expression that is practically computable for hundreds of sensors and thousands of sources. The inverse solution can then be weighted for a particular (averaged) event using the sensor covariance for that event. Model studies suggest that we may be able to localize multiple cortical sources with spatial resolution as good as PET with this technique, while retaining a much finer grained picture of activity over time.},

Variables like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface reflectance, absorbing aerosol index, and meteoroidal fields are also informative about PM2.5 concentrations. Our objective is to establish a hybrid model which incorporates multiple approaches and input variables to improve model performance. To account for complex atmospheric mechanisms, we used a neural network for its capacity to model nonlinearity and interactions. We used convolutional layers, which aggregate neighboring information, into a neural network to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation. We trained the neural network for the continental United States from 2000 to 2012 and tested it with left out monitors. Ten-fold cross-validation revealed a good model performance with a total R(2) of 0.84 on the left out monitors. Regional R(2) could be even higher for the Eastern and Central United States. Model performance was still good at low PM2.5 concentrations. Then, we used the trained neural network to make daily predictions of PM2.5 at 1 km {\texttimes} 1 km grid cells. This model allows epidemiologists to access PM2.5 exposure in both the short-term and the long-term.},

Data were analyzed to determine the effects of gender, zygosity, and age on behavioral similarities and differences between cotwins. Among same-sex cotwins, male MZ pairs were reported to behave the most similarly. Girl-boy pairs were the most dissimilar. Sex and zygosity contributed significantly to co-twin behavioral differences, with female pairs varying more on sex-typed behaviors than male pairs and DZ pairs varying more than MZ pairs. Age of twins was not a major source of differences within twin pairs.},

  abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test--retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

  abstract = {Motor cortex (M1) has been thought to form a continuous somatotopic homunculus extending down~the precentral gyrus from foot to face representations1,2, despite evidence for concentric functional zones3 and maps of complex actions4. Here, using precision functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods, we find that the classic homunculus is interrupted by regions with distinct connectivity, structure and function, alternating with effector-specific (foot, hand and mouth) areas. These inter-effector regions exhibit decreased cortical thickness and strong functional connectivity to each other, as well as to the cingulo-opercular network (CON), critical for action5 and physiological control6, arousal7, errors8 and pain9. This interdigitation of action control-linked and motor effector regions was verified in the three largest fMRI datasets. Macaque and pediatric (newborn, infant and child) precision fMRI suggested cross-species homologues and developmental precursors of the inter-effector system. A battery of motor and action fMRI tasks documented concentric effector somatotopies, separated by the CON-linked inter-effector regions. The inter-effectors lacked movement specificity and co-activated during action planning (coordination of hands and feet) and axial body movement (such as of the abdomen or eyebrows). These results, together with previous studies demonstrating stimulation-evoked complex actions4 and connectivity to internal organs10 such as the adrenal medulla, suggest that M1 is punctuated by a system for whole-body action planning, the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN). In M1, two parallel systems intertwine, forming an integrate--isolate pattern: effector-specific regions (foot, hand and mouth) for isolating fine motor control and the SCAN for integrating goals, physiology and body movement.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The continued toll of opioid-related overdoses has motivated efforts to expand availability of naloxone to persons at high risk of overdose, with 2016 federal guidance encouraging clinicians to co-prescribe naloxone to patients with increased overdose risk. Some states have pursued analogous or stricter legal requirements that could more heavily influence prescriber behavior. METHODS: We conducted a systematic legal review of state laws that mandate or recommend that healthcare providers prescribe naloxone to patients with indicators for opioid overdose risk. We coded relevant statutes and regulations for: applicable populations, patient criteria, educational requirements, and exemptions. RESULTS: As of September 2019, 17 states had enacted naloxone co-prescribing laws, the earliest of which was implemented by Louisiana in January 2016. If patient overdose risk criteria are met, over half of these states mandate that providers prescribe naloxone (7 states, 41.1 \%) or offer a naloxone prescription (2 states, 11.8 \%); the remainder encourage prescribers to consider prescribing naloxone (8 states). Most states (58.8 \%) define patient overdose risk based on opioid dosages prescribed, although the threshold varies substantially; other common overdose risk criteria include concomitant opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions and patient history of substance use disorder or mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: A growing minority of states has adopted a naloxone prescribing law, although these policies remain less prevalent than other naloxone access laws. By targeting higher-risk patients during clinical encounters, naloxone prescribing requirements could increase naloxone prescribed, destigmatize naloxone use, and reduce overdose harms. Further investigation into policy effectiveness, unintended consequences, and appropriate parameters is warranted.},

  abstract = {Abstract Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows researchers and clinicians to identify individual white matter fiber tracts and map their trajectories. The reliability and interpretability of fiber-tracking procedures is improved when a priori anatomical information is used as a guide. We have developed an automated method for labeling white matter fiber tracts in individual subjects based on a probabilistic atlas of fiber tract locations and orientations. The probabilistic fiber atlas contains 23 fiber tracts and was constructed by manually identifying fiber tracts in 21 healthy controls and 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The manual tract identification method required {$\sim$}40 h of manual editing by a trained image analyst using multiple regions of interest to select or exclude streamline fibers. Identification of fiber tracts with the atlas does not require human intervention, but nonetheless benefits from the a priori anatomical information that was used to manually identify the tracts included in the atlas. We applied this method to compare fractional anisotropy---thought to be a measure of white matter integrity---in individual fiber tracts between control subjects and patients with TLE. We found that the atlas-based and manual fiber selection methods produced a similar pattern of results. However, the between-group effect sizes using the atlas-derived fibers were generally as large or larger than those obtained with manually selected fiber tracks.

  abstract = {Abstract Context: The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is involved in the regulation of food intake and of peripheral metabolism. Although the cross talk between energy metabolism and the circadian system is well documented, little is known about a potential circadian modulation of human eCB activity. Objective: The objective of the study was to define the 24-hour profile of circulating levels of the most abundant endogenous ligand of the CB1 receptor, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in healthy young nonobese adults studied under controlled bedtime, dietary, and activity conditions. Methods: Fourteen subjects participated in this 4-day laboratory study with fixed light-dark cycles, standardized meals, and bedtimes. Sleep was recorded each night. On the third day, blood sampling at 15- to 30-minute intervals began at 9:30 pm and continued for 24 hours. Cortisol, leptin, and ghrelin were assayed on all samples, whereas the levels of 2-AG and its structural analog, 2-oleoylglycerol (2-OG), were measured at 60-minute intervals. Results: All participants exhibited a large circadian variation of 2-AG serum concentrations with a nadir around midsleep, coincident with the middle of the overnight fast. Levels of 2-AG increased continually across the morning, peaking in the early to midafternoon. Peak values represented, on average, a nearly 3-fold increase above nocturnal nadir levels. Concentrations of 2-OG followed a similar pattern, although with a shorter morning increase and lower amplitude. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that activity of the eCB system is profoundly modulated by circadian rhythmicity and suggest that its impact on the regulation of food intake is suppressed during sleep and is maximal during early to midafternoon.},

  abstract = {Aim To examine individual variability between perceived physical features and hormones of pubertal maturation in 9--10-year-old children as a function of sociodemographic characteristics. Methods Cross-sectional metrics of puberty were utilized from the baseline assessment of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study---a multi-site sample of 9--10 year-olds (n = 11,875)---and included perceived physical features via the pubertal development scale (PDS) and child salivary hormone levels (dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone in all, and estradiol in females). Multi-level models examined the relationships among sociodemographic measures, physical features, and hormone levels. A group factor analysis (GFA) was implemented to extract latent variables of pubertal maturation that integrated both measures of perceived physical features and hormone levels. Results PDS summary scores indicated more males (70\%) than females (31\%) were prepubertal. Perceived physical features and hormone levels were significantly associated with child's weight status and income, such that more mature scores were observed among children that were overweight/obese or from households with low-income. Results from the GFA identified two latent factors that described individual differences in pubertal maturation among both females and males, with factor 1 driven by higher hormone levels, and factor 2 driven by perceived physical maturation. The correspondence between latent factor 1 scores (hormones) and latent factor 2 scores (perceived physical maturation) revealed synchronous and asynchronous relationships between hormones and concomitant physical features in this large young adolescent sample. Conclusions Sociodemographic measures were associated with both objective hormone and self-report physical measures of pubertal maturation in a large, diverse sample of 9--10 year-olds. The latent variables of pubertal maturation described a complex interplay between perceived physical changes and hormone levels that hallmark sexual maturation, which future studies can examine in relation to trajectories of brain maturation, risk/resilience to substance use, and other mental health outcomes.}

  abstract = {Abstract Food frequency questionnaires ( FFQs ) are less time consuming and inexpensive instruments for collecting dietary intake when compared with 24- h dietary recalls or double-labelled water; however, the validation of FFQ is important as incorrect information may lead to biased conclusions about associations. Therefore, the relative validity of the B lock K ids F ood S creener ( BKFS ) developed for use with children was examined in a convenience sample of 99 youth recruited from the P ortland, OR metropolitan area. Three 24- h dietary recalls served as the reference. The relative validity was analysed after natural log transformation of all variables except glycaemic index prior to correlation analysis. Daily cup equivalent totals from the BKFS and `servings' from 24- h recalls were used to compute average daily intake of fruits, vegetables, potatoes, whole grains, legumes, meat/fish/poultry and dairy. Protein grams ( g ), total kcalories, glycaemic index (glucose reference), glycaemic load (glucose reference), total saturated fat ( g ) and added sugar ( g ) were also calculated by each instrument. The correlation between data obtained from the two instruments was corrected for the within-subject variation in food intake reported by the 24- h recalls using standard nutritional assessment methodology. The de-attenuated correlations in nutritional intake between the two dietary assessment instruments ranged from 0.526 for vegetables, to 0.878 for potatoes. The 24- h recall estimated higher levels of saturated fat and added sugar consumption, higher glycaemic loads and glycaemic indices; the de-attenuatted correlations of these measures ranged from 0.478 to 0.768. Assessment of B land-- A ltman plots indicated no systematic difference between the two instruments for vegetable, dairy and meat/fish/poultry fat consumption. BKFS is a useful dietary assessment instrument for the nutrients and food groups it was designed to assess in children age 10--17 years.},

  abstract = {Background: The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a parent-completed screening questionnaire often used to measure autism spectrum disorders (ASD) severity. Although child characteristics are known to influence scores from other ASD-symptom measures, as well as parent-questionnaires more broadly, there has been limited consideration of how non-ASD-specific factors may affect interpretation of SRS scores. Previous studies have explored effects of behavior problems on SRS specificity, but have not addressed influences on the use of the SRS as a quantitative measure of ASD-symptoms. Method: Raw scores (SRS-Raw) from parent-completed SRS were analyzed for 2,368 probands with ASD and 1,913 unaffected siblings. Regression analyses were used to assess associations between SRS scores and demographic, language, cognitive, and behavior measures. Results: For probands, higher SRS-Raw were associated with greater non-ASD behavior problems, higher age, and more impaired language and cognitive skills, as well as scores from other parent report measures of social development and ASD-symptoms. For unaffected siblings, having more behavior problems predicted higher SRS-Raw; male gender, younger age, and poorer adaptive social and expressive communication skills also showed small, but significant effects. Conclusions: When using the SRS as a quantitative phenotype measure, the influence of behavior problems, age, and expressive language or cognitive level on scores must be considered. If effects of non-ASD-specific factors are not addressed, SRS scores are more appropriately interpreted as indicating general levels of impairment, than as severity of ASD-specific symptoms or social impairment. Additional research is needed to consider how these factors influence the SRS' sensitivity and specificity in large, clinical samples including individuals with disorders other than ASD.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Numerous studies have documented PM 2.5 's links with adverse health outcomes. Comparatively fewer studies have evaluated specific PM 2.5 components. The lack of exposure measurements and high correlation among different PM 2.5 components are two limitations. Methods: We applied a novel exposure prediction model to obtain annual Census tract-level concentrations of 15 PM 2.5 components (Zn, V, Si, Pb, Ni, K, Fe, Cu, Ca, Br, SO 4 2- , NO 3 - , NH 4 + , OC, EC) in Massachusetts from 2000 to 2015, to which we matched geocoded deaths. All non-accidental mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality were examined for the population aged 18 or over. Weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression models were used to examine the cumulative associations between PM 2.5 components mixture and outcomes and each component's contributions to the cumulative associations. We have fit WQS models on 15 PM 2.5 components and a priori identified source groups (heavy fuel oil combustion, biomass burning, crustal matter, non-tailpipe traffic source, tailpipe traffic source, secondary particles from power plants, secondary particles from agriculture, unclear source) for the 15 PM 2.5 components. Total PM 2.5 mass analysis and single component associations were also conducted through quasi-Poisson regression models. Results: Positive cumulative associations between the components mixture and all three outcomes were observed from the WQS models. Components with large contribution to the cumulative associations included K, OC, and Fe. Biomass burning, traffic emissions, and secondary particles from power plants were identified as important source contributing to the cumulative associations. Mortality rate ratios for cardiovascular mortality were of greater magnitude than all non-accidental mortality and respiratory mortality, which is also observed in cumulative associations estimated from WQS, total PM 2.5 mass analysis, and single component associations. Conclusion: We have found positive associations between the mixture of 15 PM 2.5 components and all non-accidental mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and respiratory mortality. Among these components, Fe, K, and OC have been identified as having important contribution to the cumulative associations. The WQS results also suggests potential source effects from biomass burning, traffic emissions, and secondary particles from power plants.},

The 2015 MTF survey involved about 44,900 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students in 382 secondary schools nationwide. The first published results are presented in this report. The report begins with a synopsis of the design and methods used in the study and an overview of the key results from the 2015 survey. This is followed by a separate section for each individual drug class, providing figures that show trends in the overall proportions of students at each grade level (1) using the drug; (2) seeing a "great risk" associated with its use (perceived risk); (3) disapproving of its use (disapproval); and (4) saying that it would be fairly or very easy to get if they wanted to (perceived availability). For 12th graders, annual data are available since 1975 and for 8th and 10th graders since 1991, the first year they were included in the study.},

Mutations in the MECP2 protein cause microencephalopathy and are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders that affect both brain morphology and cognition. Although mutations in MECP2 result in severe neurological phenotypes, the effect of common variation in this genetic region is unknown. We find that common sequence variations in a region in and around MECP2 show association with structural brain size measures in 2 independent cohorts, a discovery sample from the Thematic Organized Psychosis research group, and a replication sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The most statistically significant replicated association ( P {\textbackslash}textless 0.025 in both cohorts) involved the minor allele of SNP rs2239464 with reduced cortical surface area, and the finding was specific to male gender in both populations. Variations in the MECP2 region were associated with cortical surface area but not cortical thickness. Secondary analysis showed that this allele was also associated with reduced surface area in specific cortical regions (cuneus, fusiform gyrus, pars triangularis) in both populations.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in cognition during childhood are associated with important social, physical, and mental health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Given that cortical surface arealization during development reflects the brain's functional prioritization, quantifying variation in the topography of functional brain networks across the developing cortex may provide insight regarding individual differences in cognition. We test this idea by defining personalized functional networks (PFNs) that account for interindividual heterogeneity in functional brain network topography in 9--10 year olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development{\textservicemark} Study. Across matched discovery (n\,=\,3525) and replication (n\,=\,3447) samples, the total cortical representation of fronto-parietal PFNs positively correlates with general cognition. Cross-validated ridge regressions trained on PFN topography predict cognition in unseen data across domains, with prediction accuracy increasing along the cortex's sensorimotor-association organizational axis. These results establish that functional network topography heterogeneity is associated with individual differences in cognition before the critical transition into adolescence.},

  abstract = {Childhood environments are critical in shaping cognitive neurodevelopment. With the increasing availability of large-scale neuroimaging datasets with deep phenotyping of childhood environments, we can now build upon prior studies that have considered relationships between one or a handful of environmental and neuroimaging features at a time. Here, we characterize the combined effects of hundreds of inter-connected and co-occurring features of a child's environment (``exposome'') and investigate associations with each child's unique, multidimensional pattern of functional brain network organization (``functional topography'') and cognition. We apply data-driven computational models to measure the exposome and define personalized functional brain networks in pre-registered analyses. Across matched discovery (n=5139, 48.5\% female) and replication (n=5137, 47.1\% female) samples from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, the exposome was associated with current (ages 9--10) and future (ages 11--12) cognition. Changes in the exposome were also associated with changes in cognition after accounting for baseline scores. Cross-validated ridge regressions revealed that the exposome is reflected in functional topography and can predict performance across cognitive domains. Importantly, a single measure capturing a child's exposome could more accurately and parsimoniously predict cognition than a wealth of personalized neuroimaging data, highlighting the importance of children's complex, multidimensional environments in cognitive neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {Background:Measures of socioeconomic disadvantage may enable improved targeting of programs to prevent rehospitalizations, but obtaining such information directly from patients can be difficult. Measures of U.S. neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage are more readily available but are rarely used clinically.Objective:To evaluate the association between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage at the census block group level, as measured by the Singh validated area deprivation index (ADI), and 30-day rehospitalization.Design:Retrospective cohort study.Setting:United States.Patients:Random 5\% national sample of Medicare patients discharged with congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction between 2004 and 2009 (n = 255 744).Measurements:Medicare data were linked to 2000 census data to construct an ADI for each patient's census block group, which were then sorted into percentiles by increasing ADI. Relationships between neighborhood ADI grouping and 30-day rehospitalization were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions and severity, and index hospital characteristics.Results:The 30-day rehospitalization rate did not vary significantly across the least disadvantaged 85\% of neighborhoods, which had an average rehospitalization rate of 21\%. However, within the most disadvantaged 15\% of neighborhoods, rehospitalization rates increased from 22\% to 27\% with worsening ADI. This relationship persisted after full adjustment, with the most disadvantaged neighborhoods having a rehospitalization risk (adjusted risk ratio, 1.09 [95\% CI, 1.05 to 1.12]) similar to that of chronic pulmonary disease (adjusted risk ratio, 1.06 [CI, 1.04 to 1.08]) and greater than that of uncomplicated diabetes (adjusted risk ratio, 0.95 [CI, 0.94 to 0.97]).Limitation:No direct markers of care quality or access.Conclusion:Residence within a disadvantaged U.S. neighborhood is a rehospitalization predictor of magnitude similar to chronic pulmonary disease. Measures of neighborhood disadvantage, such as the ADI, could potentially be used to inform policy and care after hospital discharge.Primary Funding Source:National Institute on Aging and University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health's Institute for Clinical and Translational Research and Health Innovation Program.},

Although these behaviors commonly co-occur, no scale exists to measure them concurrently. Based on data from two opportunity samples ( N = 691 and N = 53), this study designed and validated a composite measure of the problem behaviors noted above. The Composite Measure of Problem Behaviors, developed using exploratory factor analysis, demonstrated good psychometric properties. Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis, using both the first ( N = 691) and a third sample ( N = 740), identified a common higher order factor that accounted for covariance between behaviors. Findings thus suggest that despite the formal dissimilarity of behaviors assessed, a common function may explain their covariation. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The focus groups and a preliminary item refinement result in the 50-item Mexican American Cultural Values Scale (MACVS; identical for adolescents and adults) that includes 9 subscales. Analyses of data from two large previously published studies sampling Mexican American adolescents, mothers, and fathers provide evidence of the expected two correlated higher order factor structures, reliability, and construct validity of the subscales of the MACVS as indicators of values that are frequently associated with Mexican/Mexican American culture. The utility of this measure for use in longitudinal research and in resolving some important theoretical questions regarding dual cultural adaptation is discussed.},

Here, we investigated the effect of social influence on risk perception in 590 participants aged eight to fifty-nine-years tested in the United Kingdom. Participants rated the riskiness of everyday situations, were then informed about the rating of these situations from a (fictitious) social-influence group consisting of teenagers or adults , and then re-evaluated the situation. Our first aim was to attempt to replicate our previous finding that young adolescents are influenced more by teenagers than by adults . Second, we investigated the social-influence effect when the social-influence group's rating was more, or less, risky than the participants' own risk rating. Younger participants were more strongly influenced by teenagers than by adults , but only when teenagers rated a situation as more risky than did participants. This suggests that stereotypical characteristics of the social-influence group -- risk-prone teenagers - interact with social influence on risk perception.},

Moreover, early adolescent temperament cannot be adequately captured by measures designed for other age groups. This study examined the empirical validity of the proposed temperament factors of the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire--Revised (EATQ-R) in a large representative sample of 2,453 early adolescents aged between 10 and 12 years of age, and compared it with models that include cross-loadings between items and first-order factors, as well as first- and second-order factors. Furthermore, the reproducibility of the factor structure established by using a cross validation approach. Adding cross-loadings to the EATQ-R fit the data substantially better, resulting in an overall good fit that the original EATQ-R model did not achieve. However, the conceptual interpretation of the first- and second-order factor structures were not substantially altered even with this addition of cross-loadings. Future research should establish the construct validity of the first- and second-order factors as measured by this empirically based factor structure.},

  abstract = {Abstract The success of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is deeply rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale well beyond the usual image resolution. As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:534--546. {\copyright} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Abstract To estimate diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) measures, such as fractional anisotropy and fiber orientation, reliably, a large number of diffusion-encoded images is needed, preferably cardiac gated to reduce pulsation artifacts. However, the concomitant longer acquisition times increase the chances of subject motion adversely affecting the estimation of these measures. While correcting for motion artifacts improves the accuracy of DTI, an often overlooked step in realigning the images is to reorient the B -matrix so that orientational information is correctly preserved. To the best of our knowledge, most research groups and software packages currently omit this reorientation step. Given the recent explosion of DTI applications including, for example, neurosurgical planning (in which errors can have drastic consequences), it is important to investigate the impact of neglecting to perform the B -matrix reorientation. In this work, a systematic study to investigate the effect of neglecting to reorient the B -matrix on DTI data during motion correction is presented. The consequences for diffusion fiber tractography are also discussed. Magn Reson Med, 61:1336--1349, 2009. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Background To predict and prevent mental health crises, we must develop new approaches that can provide a dramatic advance in the effectiveness, timeliness, and scalability of our interventions. However, current methods of predicting mental health crises (eg, clinical monitoring, screening) usually fail on most, if not all, of these criteria. Luckily for us, 77\% of Americans carry with them an unprecedented opportunity to detect risk states and provide precise life-saving interventions. Smartphones present an opportunity to empower individuals to leverage the data they generate through their normal phone use to predict and prevent mental health crises. Objective To facilitate the collection of high-quality, passive mobile sensing data, we built the Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) tool to enable the generation of predictive machine learning algorithms to solve previously intractable problems and identify risk states before they become crises. Methods The EARS tool captures multiple indices of a person's social and affective behavior via their naturalistic use of a smartphone. Although other mobile data collection tools exist, the EARS tool places a unique emphasis on capturing the content as well as the form of social communication on the phone. Signals collected include facial expressions, acoustic vocal quality, natural language use, physical activity, music choice, and geographical location. Critically, the EARS tool collects these data passively, with almost no burden on the user. We programmed the EARS tool in Java for the Android mobile platform. In building the EARS tool, we concentrated on two main considerations: (1) privacy and encryption and (2) phone use impact. Results In a pilot study (N=24), participants tolerated the EARS tool well, reporting minimal burden. None of the participants who completed the study reported needing to use the provided battery packs. Current testing on a range of phones indicated that the tool consumed approximately 15\% of the battery over a 16-hour period. Installation of the EARS tool caused minimal change in the user interface and user experience. Once installation is completed, the only difference the user notices is the custom keyboard. Conclusions The EARS tool offers an innovative approach to passive mobile sensing by emphasizing the centrality of a person's social life to their well-being. We built the EARS tool to power cutting-edge research, with the ultimate goal of leveraging individual big data to empower people and enhance mental health.},

The PQ shows good preliminary validity in detecting individuals with an interview-diagnosed prodromal or psychotic syndrome, but it is less sensitive to the threshold between prodromal and full-blown psychosis.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions1--3 (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure~or~function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping4 (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain--behavioural phenotype associations5,6. Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available---with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals---to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain--phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

The 12-item scale (explaining 67.6\% of the variance for Hispanics) correlated highly with the following validation criteria: respondents' generation, length of residence in the U.S., age at arrival, ethnic self-identification, and with an acculturation index. The first factor consists of only five items and explains 54.5\% of the variance while maintaining strong correlations with the various criteria. The validity and reliability coefficients for this new short scale are comparable to those obtained for other published scales.

  abstract = {The field of research that includes transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse (collectively, trans) people is expanding. In early research, trans people were often the objects of study. As trans studies evolves, community members are turning a critical eye to research practices. In this paper we join others in presenting a call for changes at each stage of the research process. Grounded in specific examples, nine core challenges are identified. Related to research focus and study design there are problems linked to: 1) centering a cisnormative world view, 2) conducting research not identified as a priority by trans communities, and 3) lack of accountability in research design decisions. Regarding data collection and analysis, concerns include: 4) reinforcing gender binaries, 5) collapsing gender and sexual diversity, and 6) misrepresenting trans experiences through data manipulation. In terms of reporting and publishing practices, challenges are identified related to: 7) misgendering, 8) informational erasure in reporting research results, and 9) under-attention to complex informed consent dynamics. Linking the trans research ethics literature with concrete documentation of the ways researchers discuss and represent trans people and their personal information in peer-reviewed publications, this manuscript contributes to new dialogues about improving research processes with communities invested in accountability.},

In response, we present XCP-D: a collaborative effort between PennLINC at the University of Pennsylvania and the DCAN lab at the University of Minnesota. XCP-D uses an open development model on GitHub and incorporates continuous integration testing; it is distributed as a Docker container or Apptainer image. XCP-D generates denoised BOLD images and functional derivatives from resting-state data in either NIfTI or CIFTI files following pre-processing with fMRIPrep, HCP, or ABCD-BIDS pipelines. Even prior to its official release, XCP-D has been downloaded \&gt;5,000 times from DockerHub. Together, XCP-D facilitates robust, scalable, and reproducible post-processing of fMRI data.},

  abstract = {Abstract Purpose To derive and implement a method for correcting spatial distortion caused by in vivo inhomogeneous static magnetic fields in echo-planar imaging (EPI). Materials and Methods The reversed gradient method, which was initially devised to correct distortion in images generated by spin-warp MRI, was adapted to correct distortion in EP images. This method provides point-by-point correction of distortion throughout the image. EP images, acquired with a 3 T MRI system, of a phantom and a volunteer's head were used to test the correction method. Results Good correction was observed in all cases. Spatial distortion in the uncorrected images ranged up to 4 pixels (12 mm) and was corrected successfully. Conclusion The correction was improved by the application of a nonlinear interpolation scheme. The correction requires that two EP images be acquired at each slice position. This increases the acquisition time, but an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is seen in the corrected image. The local SNR gain decreases with increasing distortion. In many EPI acquisition schemes, multiple images are averaged at each slice position to increase the SNR; in such cases the reversed gradient correction method can be applied with no increase in acquisition duration.

  abstract = {The thalamic nuclei are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases and therefore, their identification is of key importance in numerous clinical treatments. Automated segmentation of thalamic subparts is currently achieved by exploring diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), but in absence of such data, atlas-based segmentation can be used as an alternative. Currently, there is a limited number of available digital atlases of the thalamus. Moreover, all atlases are created using a few subjects only, thus are prone to errors due to the inter-subject variability of the thalamic morphology. In this work, we present a probabilistic atlas of anatomical subparts of the thalamus built upon a relatively large dataset where the individual thalamic parcellation was done by employing a recently proposed automatic diffusion-based clustering method. Our analyses, comparing the segmentation performance between the atlas-based and the clustering method, demonstrate the ability of the provided atlas to substitute the automated diffusion-based subdivision in the individual space when the DW-MRI is not available.},

We focused on screening accuracy and paid particular attention to comparison groups. Inclusion criteria required that scales be developed post ICD-10, be ASD-specific, and have published evidence of diagnostic validity in peer-reviewed journals. The five scales reviewed were: the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale/Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (GARS/GARS-2), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), and Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS). Twenty total studies were located, most examining the SCQ. Research on the other scales was limited. Comparisons between scales were few and available evidence of diagnostic validity is scarce for certain subpopulations (e.g., lower functioning individuals, PDDNOS). Overall, the SCQ performed well, the SRS and ASSQ showed promise, and the GARS/GARS-2 and ASDS demonstrated poor sensitivity. This review indicates that Level 2 ASD caregiver-completed rating scales are in need of much more scientific scrutiny.},

However, many of the discussions were simplified to the notion that states either have a medical marijuana law or do not; little reference was made to the fact that legal provisions differ across states. This study seeks to clarify the characteristics of medical marijuana laws in place since 1990 that are most relevant to consumers/patients and categorizes those aspects most likely to affect the prevalence of use, and consequently the intensity of public health and welfare effects. Evidence shows treating medical marijuana laws as homogeneous across states is misleading and does not reflect the reality of medical marijuana lawmaking. This variation likely has implications for use and health outcomes, and thus states' public health.},

In the current study, we examined the factor structure of the BIS/BAS Scales across 5 age groups: 6- to 10-year-old children (N = 229), 11- to 13-year-old early adolescents (N = 311), 14- to 16-year-old late adolescents (N = 353), 18- to 22-year-old young adults (N = 844), and 30- to 45-year-old adults (N = 471). Given poor fit of the standard 4-factor model (BIS, Reward Responsivity, Drive, Fun Seeking) in the literature, we conducted exploratory factor analyses in half of the participants and identified problematic items across age groups. The 4-factor model showed poor fit in our sample, whereas removing the BAS Fun Seeking subscale and problematic items from the remaining subscales improved fit in confirmatory factor analyses conducted with the second half of the participants. The revised model showed strict invariance across age groups and by sex, indicating consistent factor structure, item loadings, thresholds, and unique or residual variances. Additionally, in our cross-sectional data, we observed nonlinear relations between age and subscale scores, where scores tended to be higher in young adulthood than in childhood and later adulthood. Furthermore, sex differences emerged across development; adolescent and adult females had higher BIS scores than males in this age range, whereas sex differences were not observed in childhood. These differences may help us to understand the rise in internalizing psychopathology in adolescence, particularly in females. Future developmental studies are warranted to examine the impact of rewording problematic items.},

  abstract = {Physical health in childhood is crucial for neurobiological as well as overall development, and can shape long-term outcomes into adulthood. The landmark, longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study SM (ABCD study {\textregistered} ), was designed to investigate brain development and health in almost 12,000 youth who were recruited when they were 9--10 years old and will be followed through adolescence and early adulthood. The overall goal of this paper is to provide descriptive analyses of physical health measures in the ABCD study at baseline, including but not limited to sleep, physical activity and sports involvement, and body mass index. Further this summary will describe how physical health measures collected from the ABCD cohort compare with current normative data and clinical guidelines. We propose this data set has the potential to facilitate clinical recommendations and inform national standards of physical health in this age group. This manuscript will also provide important information for ABCD users and help guide analyses investigating physical health including new avenues for health disparity research as it pertains to adolescent and young adult development.}

At the same time, these developments have led to an increasing need for a high-resolution probabilistic in vivo anatomical atlas of subcortical nuclei. In order to address this need, we constructed high spatial resolution, three-dimensional templates, using high-accuracy diffeomorphic registration of T1- and T2- weighted structural images from 168 typical adults between 22 and 35 years old. In these templates, many tissue boundaries are clearly visible, which would otherwise be impossible to delineate in data from individual studies. The resulting delineations of subcortical nuclei complement current histology-based atlases. We further created a companion library of software tools for atlas development, to offer an open and evolving resource for the creation of a crowd-sourced in vivo probabilistic anatomical atlas of the human brain.},

  abstract = {The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aims to measure the trajectories of brain, cognitive, and emotional development. Cognitive and behavioural development during late childhood and adolescence have been associated with a myriad of microstructural and morphological alterations across the brain, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These associations may be strongly localised or spatially diffuse, therefore, it would be advantageous to analyse multimodal MRI data in concert, and across the whole brain. The ABCD study presents the unique challenge of integrating multimodal data from tens of thousands of scans at multiple timepoints, within a reasonable computation time. To address the need for a multimodal registration and atlas for the ABCD dataset, we present the synthesis of an ABCD atlas using the Multimodal Image Normalisation Tool (MINT). The MINT ABCD atlas was generated from baseline and two-year follow up imaging data using an iterative approach to synthesise a cohort-specific atlas from linear and nonlinear deformations of eleven channels of diffusion and structural MRI data. We evaluated the performance of MINT against two widely used methods and show that MINT achieves comparable alignment to current state-of-the-art multimodal registration, at a fraction of the computation time. To validate the use of the ABCD MINT atlas in whole brain, voxelwise analysis, we replicate and expand on previously published region-of-interest analysis between diffusion MRI-derived measures and body mass index (BMI). We also report novel association between BMI and brain morphology derived from the registration deformations. We present the ABCD MINT atlas as a publicly available resource to facilitate whole brain voxelwise analyses for the ABCD study.},

A path analysis showed that higher depression/anxiety scores and lower intergroup competence predicted more PD; depression/anxiety and intergroup competence were in turn predicted by self-esteem and mastery, respectively. Birthplace and socioeconomic status had an indirect effect on PD, via intergroup competence. The results suggest the importance of psychological variables in the perception of discrimination.},

  abstract = {Aims. Recent research suggests that people who become smokers may be more sensitive to the positive effects of nicotine than those who do not take up smoking . Design and setting. The present study was designed to investigate this hypothesis by querying initial experiences with cigarette smoking in smokers, ex-smokers and never-smokers recruited from the local community . Participants. Subjects were 80 women (23 highly dependent smokers (Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire score 7), 30 less-dependent smokers (FTQ6), 12 ex-smokers and 15 never-smokers) . Measurements. Subjects were asked to rate pleasurable sensations and displeasurable sensations on a scale of 1=none to 4=intense, and to indicate the presence or absence of pleasurable rush or buzz, relaxation, dizziness, nausea and cough; social context was also queried. Pleasurable rush or buzz, relaxation, dizziness, nausea and cough were related to ratings of pleasurable and unpleasant sensations to establish their affective valence . Findings. Pleasurable sensations, pleasurable rush or buzz and relaxation (pleasant effects) were significantly more likely to occur in the smoker categories than in never-smokers. The ratio of pleasurable to unpleasant sensations, computed as an index of overall hedonic impact of initial exposure, also significantly favored the smoker categories. By contrast, unpleasant sensations, nausea and cough (unpleasant effects) did not differ significantly among groups. Dizziness, which did not definitely emerge as either pleasurable or unpleasant, was significantly more likely to be reported among the smoker groups than among never-smokers . Conclusions. People who become highly dependent cigarette smokers appear to have more pleasurable sensations at their initial exposure to tobacco; unpleasant reactions to the first cigarette do not seem to protect against subsequent smoking.},

  abstract = {Background There are known associations between mental health symptoms and transgender identity among adults. Whether this relationship extends to early adolescents and to gender domains other than identity is unclear. This study measured dimensions of gender in a large, diverse, sample of youth, and examined associations between diverse gender experiences and mental health. Methods The ABCD study is an ongoing, longitudinal, US cohort study. Baseline data (release 2.0) include 11,873 youth age 9/10 (48\% female); and the 4,951 1-year follow-up visits (age 10/11; 48\% female) completed prior to data release. A novel gender survey at the 1-year visit assessed felt-gender, gender noncontentedness, and gender nonconformity using a 5-point scale. Mental health measures included youth- and parent-reports. Results Roughly half a percent of 9/10-year-olds ( n = 58) responded `yes' or `maybe' when asked, `Are you transgender' at baseline. Recurrent thoughts of death were more prevalent among these youth compared to the rest of the cohort (19.6\% vs. 6.4\%, {$\chi$} 2 = 16.0, p {\textbackslash}textless .001). At the 1-year visit, when asked about the three dimensions of gender on a 5-point scale, 33.2\% ( n = 1,605) provided responses that were not exclusively and totally aligned with one gender. Significant relationships were observed between mental health symptoms and gender diversity for all dimensions assessed. Conclusions Similar to adult studies, early adolescents identifying as transgender reported increased mental health symptoms. Results also point to considerable diversity in other dimensions of gender (felt-gender, gender noncontentedness, gender nonconformity) among 10/11-year-olds, and find this diversity to be related to critical mental health symptoms. These findings add to our limited understanding of the relationship between dimensions of gender and wellness for youth.},

  abstract = {Childhood and adolescence are important developmental phases which influence health and well-being across the life span. Social relationships are fundamental to child and adolescent development; yet studies have been limited to children's relationships with other humans. This paper provides an evidence review for the potential associations between pet ownership and emotional; behavioural; cognitive; educational and social developmental outcomes. As the field is in the early stages; a broad set of inclusion criteria was applied. A systematic search of databases and grey literature sources found twenty-two studies meeting selection criteria. The review found evidence for an association between pet ownership and a wide range of emotional health benefits from childhood pet ownership; particularly for self-esteem and loneliness. The findings regarding childhood anxiety and depression were inconclusive. Studies also showed evidence of an association between pet ownership and educational and cognitive benefits; for example, in perspective-taking abilities and intellectual development. Evidence on behavioural development was unclear due to a lack of high quality research. Studies on pet ownership and social development provided evidence for an association with increased social competence; social networks; social interaction and social play behaviour. Overall, pet ownership and the significance of children's bonds with companion animals have been underexplored; there is a shortage of high quality and longitudinal studies in all outcomes. Prospective studies that control for a wide range of confounders are required.},

Methods Sexually active adolescent females ( N = 159) ages 15--19 were recruited from a health clinic in a low-income, urban area of southeast San Diego County, California to complete a tablet-administered survey that included items on sexual violence and harassment, including CSH. Using logistic regression models, we assessed CSH in relation to substance use, poor mental health outcomes and STI history. Results Participants were, on average, 17 years of age and half were currently in a relationship. The majority of girls (68\%) reported at least one form of CSH, which included receiving unwanted sexual messages/photos (53\%), receiving unwanted messages asking them to do something sexual (49\%), being pressured to send sexual photos (36\%), and having sexual photos shared without permission (6\%). Perpetrators included known and unknown males; almost a third (27\%) reported perpetration by a relationship partner. In logistic regression models adjusting for race, CSH was associated with: past 30-day alcohol use, drug use (ever), feeling depressed (past 30 days), and feeling anxious (past 30 days) (Odds Ratios ranged: 2.9--7.5). CSH was also associated with past-year suicidal thoughts and STI diagnosis (ever) (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05, ORs not presented due to small numbers). Conclusions Our findings suggest that in some subgroups, CSH appears to be affecting the majority of girls, which is especially concerning given its association with multiple poor health outcomes.},

A logistic analysis found the gender of the relative and alcoholism in the informant to be significant, but not the gender of the informant. The partial odds ratio of a diagnosis at interview associated with a positive family history diagnosis was 13.6. The relationship between the informant and relative was significant, with negative reports from an offspring or mate more influential than a negative report from a parent or second-degree relative. We derived a recursive equation to combine a variable number of family history reports, wherein the probabilities associated with a single report are computed from the logistic analysis. This permits the use of family history information both as a proxy for an uninterviewed relative, as well as a second source of information to be used in the analysis of genetic family data.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objectives: Results from research conducted on the association between cannabis use and body mass index (BMI) reveal mixed findings. It is possible that individual differences in decision-making (DM) abilities may influence these associations. Methods: This study analyzed how amount of cannabis use, DM performance, and the interaction of these variables influenced BMI and clinical classifications of weight among adolescents (ages 14 to 18 years; 56\% male; 77\% Hispanic). The sample consisted primarily of cannabis users ( n =238) without a history of significant developmental disorders, birth complications, neurological conditions, or history of mood, thought, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder at screening. Furthermore, few participants engaged frequently in other drug use (except for alcohol and nicotine). Results: Analyses revealed that more lifetime cannabis use was associated with a higher BMI and greater likelihood of being overweight/obese. Interactions between DM and cannabis use on BMI were not significant, and DM was not directly associated with BMI. Discussion: Our findings suggest that among adolescents, cannabis use is associated with a greater BMI regardless of DM abilities and this association is not accounted for by other potential factors, including depression, alcohol use, nicotine use, race, ethnicity, or IQ.

The Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale (PACS) was administered to 522 African American female adolescents ranging in age from 14 to 18. The PACS demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (across multiple administrations) and acceptable test-retest reliability over a 12-month follow-up period. Concurrently, scores on the PACS were correlated with frequency of sexual communication with partner, sexual communication self-efficacy (boyfriend), perceived parental knowledge, family support, depression, and condom use with steady male sex partners. Prospectively, baseline PACS scores were correlated with frequency of sexual communication with partner and condom use. The present investigation indicates that the PACS is a reliable and valid measure of frequency of sexual communication between female adolescents and their parents. Utility of the PACS for researchers and practitioners is discussed.},

  abstract = {AIMS: A low level of response (LR) to alcohol is a characteristic of sons of alcoholics and predicts an elevated future alcoholism risk. A 12-question Self-Rating of the Effects (SRE) of alcohol form has been shown to correlate cross-sectionally with a designation of a low LR determined by alcohol challenges. DESIGN: This study evaluates the potential usefulness of the SRE as a retrospective measure of both the response to alcohol and of subsequent alcoholism in two samples. SETTING: All subjects were studied in the United States, most in California. PARTICIPANTS: First, 94 sons of alcoholics and controls completed the SRE 15 years after an alcohol challenge, and SRE values were compared to their prior LR results and their alcoholic outcomes. Secondly, the relationship between SRE results and alcoholic status was determined in 551 men and women alcoholics, their relatives, and controls. MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were evaluated with face-to-face interviews. FINDINGS: Despite the interval of 15 years, the correlation between the SRE and the subjective high feelings on the alcohol challenge was between -0.3 and -0.4. For those 94 subjects the full SRE correlated with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence at 0.5, a figure that remained at 0.3 even when only the estimates related to the earliest drinking experiences were considered. For the 551 men and women, the correlation between the SRE and alcohol dependence diagnoses was 0.6, including 0.3 for the estimates of the first five times of drinking. All major findings in both samples remained robust when the recent drinking history or the number of items endorsed was considered, or when the most severe alcohol problem, passing out, was deleted from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: When alcohol challenges are not possible, these retrospective reports indicate that the SRE is a potentially useful surrogate for determining a subgroup of people who might carry a low level of response to alcohol and a subsequent elevated risk for alcoholism.},

  abstract = {Abstract Subject motion degrades the quality of task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Here, we test two classes of methods to counteract the effects of motion in task fMRI data: (1) a variety of motion regressions and (2) motion censoring (``motion scrubbing''). In motion regression, various regressors based on realignment estimates were included as nuisance regressors in general linear model (GLM) estimation. In motion censoring, volumes in which head motion exceeded a threshold were withheld from GLM estimation. The effects of each method were explored in several task fMRI data sets and compared using indicators of data quality and signal-to-noise ratio. Motion censoring decreased variance in parameter estimates within- and across-subjects, reduced residual error in GLM estimation, and increased the magnitude of statistical effects. Motion censoring performed better than all forms of motion regression and also performed well across a variety of parameter spaces, in GLMs with assumed or unassumed response shapes. We conclude that motion censoring improves the quality of task fMRI data and can be a valuable processing step in studies involving populations with even mild amounts of head movement.

  abstract = {Background: Despite its ubiquity, hangover has received remarkably little systematic attention in alcohol research. This may be due in part to the lack of a standard measure of hangover symptoms that cleanly taps the physiologic and subjective effects commonly experienced the morning after drinking. In the present study, we developed and evaluated a new scale, the Hangover Symptoms Scale (HSS), to potentially fill this void. Methods: Participants were 1230 currently drinking college students (62\% women, 91\% Caucasian). They were administered a self-report inventory in which they reported the frequency of occurrence of 13 different hangover symptoms during the past 12 months. Participants also reported their history of alcohol involvement, alcohol-related problems, and family history of alcohol-related problems. Results: On average, participants experienced 5 out of 13 different hangover symptoms in the past year; the three most common symptoms were feeling extremely thirsty/dehydrated, feeling more tired than usual, and headache. Higher scores on the HSS were significantly positively associated with the frequency of drinking and getting drunk and the typical quantity of alcohol consumed when drinking, a personal history of alcohol-related problems, and a family history of alcohol-related problems. After controlling for sex differences in alcohol involvement, women had higher scores on the HSS than men. Conclusions: The HSS appears to capture a reasonably valid set of adjectives describing common hangover effects. It is hoped that the availability of a brief, valid hangover assessment such as the HSS will encourage further study of hangover's frequency, correlates, and consequences. Future research is needed to explore the performance of a re-worded HSS in laboratory settings, which may help bridge the gap between laboratory and survey investigations of hangover.},

  abstract = {Background A common single nucleotide polymorphism (C385A) in the human fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) gene has been associated with decreased distress responses in healthy volunteers, but its role in psychiatric disorders remains unknown. Here, we obtained genotypes and carried out a secondary analysis of subjects from a trial of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and alcohol dependence ( AD ). We evaluated the effects of C385A variation on behavioral and biochemical biomarkers of distress responses. Methods Forty-nine patients with PTSD and AD were admitted for 4 weeks to an experimental medicine unit at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Following detoxification, stress reactivity and peripheral endocannabinoid (eCB) levels were assessed in response to a challenge session using personalized auditory guided imagery. Over the course of the study, subjects were also evaluated for changes in PTSD symptom severity. Results FAAH C385A allele carriers showed a marked increase in serum anandamide levels at baseline and throughout the stress challenge procedure compared with C allele homozygotes, while levels of eCBs primarily metabolized through other enzymatic activity, such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol, did not differ between genotype groups. FAAH C385A carriers also had decreased subjective anxiety responses to the stress challenge. Similar effects of FAAH C385A genotype were found at the level of clinical PTSD symptom severity, in particular in the arousal domain. Conclusions This is to our knowledge the first study showing that FAAH C385A variation modulates stress responses in subjects with disorders characterized by increased stress reactivity. These findings point to the eCB pathway as a promising target for future antistress therapeutics.},

Gridded climate datasets (GCD) provide spatially resolved weather data that may offer improved exposure estimates, but have not been systematically validated for use in epidemiologic evaluations. As a validation, we linearly regressed daily weather estimates from two GCDs, PRISM and Daymet, to observations from a sample of weather stations across the conterminous United States and compared spatially resolved, population-weighted county average temperatures and heat indices from PRISM to single-pixel PRISM values at the weather stations to identify differences. We found that both Daymet and PRISM accurately estimate ambient temperature and mean heat index at sampled weather stations, but PRISM outperforms Daymet for assessments of humidity and maximum daily heat index. Moreover, spatially-resolved exposure estimates differ from point-based assessments, but with substantial inter-county heterogeneity. We conclude that GCDs offer a potentially useful approach to exposure assessment of meteorological variables that may, in some locations, reduce exposure measurement error, as well as permit assessment of populations distributed far from weather stations.},

  abstract = {Monitoring (tracking and surveillance) of children's behavior is considered an essential parenting skill. Numerous studies show that well-monitored youths are less involved in delinquency and other normbreaking behaviors, and scholars conclude that parents should track their children more carefully. This study questions that conclusion. We point out that monitoring measures typically assess parents' knowledge but not its source, and parents could get knowledge from their children's free disclosure of information as well as their own active surveillance efforts. In our study of 703 14-year-olds in central Sweden and their parents, parental knowledge came mainly from child disclosure, and child disclosure was the source of knowledge that was most closely linked to broad and narrow measures of delinquency (normbreaking and police contact). These results held for both children's and parents' reports, for both sexes, and were independent of whether the children were exhibiting problem behavior or not. We conclude that tracking and surveillance is not the best prescription for parental behavior and that a new prescription must rest on an understanding of the factors that determine child disclosure.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of cyberbullying is essential for intervention planning and evaluation. Limitations to many currently available self-report measures of cyberbullying victimization include a lack of psychometric information and a limited scope (i.e., not assessing multiple electronic mediums of cybervictimization). To address these limitations, we developed and investigated the psychometric properties of a broad self-report measure of cyberbullying, the Cyberbullying Scale (CBS). We examined the factor structure and reliability of the CBS across 736 students in Grades 6 to 12 in six Northern Mississippi schools. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) results indicated that the structure of the CBS was best represented by a one-factor model. The finding of a single-factor structure suggests that cyberbullying is a unidimensional construct, which is consistent with previous research. In the current sample, the CBS demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's {$\alpha$} = .94) and significant positive correlations with related constructs of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Results from the present study provide initial support for the CBS as a measure of cybervictimization among adolescents.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present initial validity data on three web-based computerized versions of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS-COMP). METHOD: The sample for evaluating the validity of the clinician-administered KSADS-COMP included 511 youths 6-18 years of age who were participants in the Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network. The sample for evaluating the parent and youth self-administered versions of the KSADS-COMP included 158 youths 11-17 years of age recruited from three academic institutions. RESULTS: Average administration time for completing the combined parent and youth clinician-administered KSADS-COMP was less time than previously reported for completing the paper-and-pencil K-SADS with only one informant (91.9 {\textpm} 50.1 minutes). Average administration times for the youth and parent self-administered KSADS-COMP were 50.9 {\textpm} 28.0 minutes and 63.2 {\textpm} 38.3 minutes, respectively, and youths and parents rated their experience using the web-based self-administered KSADS-COMP versions very positively. Diagnoses generated with all three KSADS-COMP versions demonstrated good convergent validity against established clinical rating scales and dimensional diagnostic-specific ratings derived from the KSADS-COMP. When parent and youth self-administered KSADS-COMP data were integrated, good to excellent concordance was also achieved between diagnoses derived using the self-administered and clinician-administered KSADS-COMP versions (area under the curve = 0.89-1.00). CONCLUSION: The three versions of the KSADS-COMP demonstrate promising psychometric properties, while offering efficiency in administration and scoring. The clinician-administered KSADS-COMP shows utility not only for research, but also for implementation in clinical practice, with self-report preinterview ratings that streamline administration. The self-administered KSADS-COMP versions have numerous potential research and clinical applications, including in large-scale epidemiological studies, in schools, in emergency departments, and in telehealth to address the critical shortage of child and adolescent mental health specialists.

  abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics---high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies ( n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2--12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.},

  abstract = {Background Concerns abound regarding childhood smartphone use, but studies to date have largely relied on self-reported screen use. Self-reporting of screen use is known to be misreported by pediatric samples and their parents, limiting the accurate determination of the impact of screen use on social, emotional, and cognitive development. Thus, a more passive, objective measurement of smartphone screen use among children is needed. Objective This study aims to passively sense smartphone screen use by time and types of apps used in a pilot sample of children and to assess the feasibility of passive sensing in a larger longitudinal sample. Methods The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study used passive, objective phone app methods for assessing smartphone screen use over 4 weeks in 2019-2020 in a subsample of 67 participants (aged 11-12 years; 31/67, 46\% female; 23/67, 34\% White). Children and their parents both reported average smartphone screen use before and after the study period, and they completed a questionnaire regarding the acceptability of the study protocol. Descriptive statistics for smartphone screen use, app use, and protocol feasibility and acceptability were reviewed. Analyses of variance were run to assess differences in categorical app use by demographics. Self-report and parent report were correlated with passive sensing data. Results Self-report of smartphone screen use was partly consistent with objective measurement (r=0.49), although objective data indicated that children used their phones more than they reported. Passive sensing revealed the most common types of apps used were for streaming (mean 1 hour 57 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 32 minutes), communication (mean 48 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 17 minutes), gaming (mean 41 minutes per day, SD 41 minutes), and social media (mean 36 minutes per day, SD 1 hour 7 minutes). Passive sensing of smartphone screen use was generally acceptable to children (43/62, 69\%) and parents (53/62, 85\%). Conclusions The results of passive, objective sensing suggest that children use their phones more than they self-report. Therefore, use of more robust methods for objective data collection is necessary and feasible in pediatric samples. These data may then more accurately reflect the impact of smartphone screen use on behavioral and emotional functioning. Accordingly, the ABCD study is implementing a passive sensing protocol in the full ABCD cohort. Taken together, passive assessment with a phone app provided objective, low-burden, novel, informative data about preteen smartphone screen use.},

  abstract = {Abstract Water diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a powerful tool for studying biological tissue microarchitectures in vivo. Recently, there has been increased effort to develop quantitative dMRI methods to probe both length scale and orientation information in diffusion media. Diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) is one such approach that aims to resolve such information based on the three-dimensional diffusion propagator at each voxel. However, in practice, only the orientation component of the propagator function is preserved when deriving the orientation distribution function. Here, we demonstrate how a straightforward extension of the linear spherical deconvolution (SD) model can be used to probe tissue orientation structures over a range (or ``spectrum'') of length scales with minimal assumptions on the underlying microarchitecture. Using high b -value Cartesian q -space data on a rat brain tissue sample, we demonstrate how this ``restriction spectrum imaging'' (RSI) model allows for separating the volume fraction and orientation distribution of hindered and restricted diffusion, which we argue stems primarily from diffusion in the extraneurite and intraneurite water compartment, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate how empirical RSI estimates of the neurite orientation distribution and volume fraction capture important additional structure not afforded by traditional DSI or fixed-scale SD-like reconstructions, particularly in gray matter. We conclude that incorporating length scale information in geometric models of diffusion offers promise for advancing state-of-the-art dMRI methods beyond white matter into gray matter structures while allowing more detailed quantitative characterization of water compartmentalization and histoarchitecture of healthy and diseased tissue.

  abstract = {Abstract Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been at the forefront of cancer imaging since the early 2000s. Before its application in clinical oncology, this powerful technique had already achieved widespread recognition due to its utility in the diagnosis of cerebral infarction. Following this initial success, the ability of DWI to detect inherent tissue contrast began to be exploited in the field of oncology. Although the initial oncologic applications for tumor detection and characterization, assessing treatment response, and predicting survival were primarily in the field of neurooncology, the scope of DWI has since broadened to include oncologic imaging of the prostate gland, breast, and liver. Despite its growing success and application, misconceptions about the underlying physical basis of the DWI signal exist among researchers and clinicians alike. In this review, we provide a detailed explanation of the biophysical basis of diffusion contrast, emphasizing the difference between hindered and restricted diffusion, and elucidating how diffusion parameters in tissue are derived from the measurements via the diffusion model. We describe one advanced DWI modeling technique, called restriction spectrum imaging (RSI). This technique offers a more direct in vivo measure of tumor cells, due to its ability to distinguish separable pools of water within tissue based on their intrinsic diffusion characteristics. Using RSI as an example, we then highlight the ability of advanced DWI techniques to address key clinical challenges in neurooncology, including improved tumor conspicuity, distinguishing actual response to therapy from pseudoresponse, and delineation of white matter tracts in regions of peritumoral edema. We also discuss how RSI, combined with new methods for correction of spatial distortions inherent in diffusion MRI scans, may enable more precise spatial targeting of lesions, with implications for radiation oncology and surgical planning.

This history is rooted in assimilation policies, historical trauma, and cultural loss, and is promulgated through discrimination and disregard for traditional culture and community knowledge. In recognition of this history, it is imperative for researchers to utilize culturally sensitive approaches that consider the context of tribal communities to better address mental health issues for AIAN individuals. The public availability of data from large-scale studies creates both opportunities and challenges when studying mental health within AIAN populations. This manuscript has two goals; first, showcase an example of problematic use of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study SM data to promulgate stereotypes about AIAN individuals and, second, in partnership with collaborators from Cherokee Nation, we provide five recommendations for utilizing data from publicly available datasets to advance health research in AIAN populations. Specifically, we argue for the consideration of (1) the heterogeneity of the communities represented, (2) the importance of focusing on AIAN health and well-being, (3) engagement of relevant communities and AIAN community leaders, (4) consideration of historical and ongoing injustices, and (5) engagement with AIAN regulatory agencies or review boards. These recommendations are founded on principles from broader indigenous research efforts emphasizing community-engaged research and principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Governance.},

In order to build the nomological network surrounding this scale, the UPPS was administered to individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), pathological gamblers (PG), alcohol abusers (divided into two groups based on the presence of antisocial features), and a control group. Several of the UPPS scales (e.g. Urgency, lack of Premeditation, and Sensation Seeking) differentiated the BPD, PG, and alcohol abusers with antisocial features from a group of non-antisocial alcohol abusers and a control group. Overall, the UPPS scales accounted for between 7\% (pathological gambling) and 64\% (borderline personality disorder features) of the overall variance in the psychopathology measures. Individual UPPS scales also made unique contributions to several of these disorders, which may provide insight into which of these personality traits may predispose individuals to behave in maladaptive or problematic ways. The results provide support for the differentiation of impulsivity-related constructs into the current four-factor model. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background: Self-reported physical activity is often inaccurate. Wearable devices utilizing multiple sensors are now widespread. The aim of this study was to determine acceptability of Fitbit Charge HR for children and their families, and to determine best practices for processing its objective data. Methods: Data were collected via Fitbit Charge HR continuously over the course of 3 weeks. Questionnaires were given to each child and their parent/guardian to determine the perceived usability of the device. Patterns of data were evaluated and best practice inclusion criteria recommended. Results: Best practices were established to extract, filter, and process data to evaluate device wear, r and establish minimum wear time to evaluate behavioral patterns. This resulted in usable data available from 137 (89\%) of the sample. Conclusions: Activity trackers are highly acceptable in the target population and can provide objective data over longer periods of wear. Best practice inclusion protocols that reflect physical activity in youth are provided.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT High school students were offered a monetary incentive for participating in research. They were given a choice between a smaller fee immediately or a larger fee one week later. Compared to students who delayed gratification, those who chose the immediate fee showed more self-regulatory deficits. They showed greater involvement with cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana, had a poorer self-concept and underperformed academically. A replication study with middle-school students and different reward parameters yielded equivalent results. Younger adolescents who chose the immediate monetary incentive showed a similar pattern of problem behaviors as the high school students. The findings indicate that this simple choice-delay procedure yields an unobtrusive behavioral measure of self-regulation and offers a developmentally appropriate extension of the delay-of-gratification paradigm for use with older children and adolescents.},

  abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

  abstract = {Abstract Purpose To correct eddy-current artifacts in diffusion tensor (DT) images without the need to obtain auxiliary scans for the sole purpose of correction. Materials and Methods DT images are susceptible to distortions caused by eddy currents induced by large diffusion gradients. We propose a new postacquisition correction algorithm that does not require any auxiliary reference scans. It also avoids the problematic procedure of cross-correlating images with significantly different contrasts. A linear model is used to describe the dependence of distortion parameters (translation, scaling, and shear) on the diffusion gradients. The model is solved numerically to provide an individual correction for every diffusion-weighted (DW) image. Results The assumptions of the linear model were successfully verified in a series of experiments on a silicon oil phantom. The correction obtained for this phantom was compared with correction obtained by a previously published method. The algorithm was then shown to markedly reduce eddy-current distortions in DT images from human subjects. Conclusion The proposed algorithm can accurately correct eddy-current artifacts in DT images. Its principal advantages are that only images with comparable signals and contrasts are cross-correlated, and no additional scans are required. J. Magn. Reson.
